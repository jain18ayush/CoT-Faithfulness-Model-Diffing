Osteosarcoma\nC. Osteoid osteoma\nD. Chondrosarcoma", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a 7-year-old child with a lesion in the upper tibia, accompanied by an X-ray showing a radiolucent area with Codman's triangle and a Sunray appearance, is B. Osteosarcoma. This diagnosis aligns with the common features seen in osteosarcoma cases, especially in pediatric patients, and is characterized by the described aggressive periosteal reaction and distinct radiographic patterns."}
{"question": "What is an effective and esthetic treatment for generalized intrinsic tetracycline stains in a 26-year-old female patient who complains of discolored teeth?", "gold_answer": "An effective and esthetic treatment for generalized intrinsic tetracycline stains in a 26-year-old female patient is the application of porcelain veneers. Veneers can mask deep dark stains exceptionally well and provide a natural-looking appearance by covering the surface of the teeth without requiring extensive removal of the tooth structure. Compared to teeth whitening or crowns, veneers offer a more practical solution for such intrinsic stains, maintaining tooth integrity while delivering a significant cosmetic improvement."}
{"question": "A 24-year-old man presents with a painless genital ulcer and moderate inguinal lymphadenopathy but no buboes. Considering his recent history of unprotected sex with multiple partners and the characteristics of the ulcer, which laboratory test would confirm the diagnosis of syphilis in this patient?", "gold_answer": "To confirm the diagnosis of syphilis in this patient, a treponemal test is needed after an initial positive result from a non-treponemal test like the RPR or VDRL. Treponemal tests, such as the Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption (FTA-ABS) test or a Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) test, detect antibodies specific to Treponema pallidum, the bacterium causing syphilis. These tests are used to confirm a syphilis diagnosis due to their high specificity. Therefore, after suspecting syphilis from the clinical presentation and having a positive non-treponemal test, a treponemal test like the FTA-ABS will confirm the diagnosis."}
{"question": "In a case control study on smoking and lung cancer, out of 35 lung cancer patients, 33 are smokers. Out of 82 controls, 27 are non smokers. Find the odds ratio:\nA. 0.21\nB. 8.1\nC. 4.1\nD. 2.1", "gold_answer": "The odds ratio for the given study is 8.1. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 8.1. This means that according to the study, smokers are about 8.1 times more likely to have lung cancer compared to non-smokers in the control group."}
{"question": "In the treatment of severe bradycardia, which medication is not considered an appropriate treatment modality?", "gold_answer": "In the treatment of severe bradycardia, beta-blockers are not considered an appropriate treatment modality. Beta-blockers can further slow the heart rate, which is counterproductive when addressing bradycardia. Treatment typically involves medications that can increase the heart rate, such as atropine, and if necessary, dopamine or epinephrine."}
{"question": "A 70-year-old gentleman who met with an accident is able to localize pain when pinched, opens his eyes to painful stimuli, and is confused about his location and the circumstances of the accident. Based on this information, what is his minimum Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?", "gold_answer": "The minimum Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score for the 70-year-old gentleman, based on the information provided, is 11. This score is derived as follows: \n\n- Eye-opening response to pain scores a 2.\n- Verbal response being confused scores a 4.\n- Motor response by localizing pain scores a 5.\n\nAdding these scores together, we get a total GCS of 11."}
{"question": "A 3-month-old boy is experiencing repeated episodes of infections, delayed umbilical cord separation, and laboratory studies indicate a high leukocyte count with a predominance of neutrophils and the presence of catalase-positive yeast cells forming pseudohyphae. Based on these clinical findings and laboratory results, what is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms described in the 3-month-old boy suggest a condition related to immune system dysfunction. Specifically, the combination of repeated infections, delayed separation of the umbilical cord, and a high leukocyte count with predominance of neutrophils aligns well with Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD).\n\nLeukocyte Adhesion Deficiency is characterized by defects in the adhesion and migration of neutrophils, which consequently impairs the immune system's ability to fight infections effectively. The delayed separation of the umbilical cord is particularly suggestive of LAD, as this condition leads to impaired wound healing due to the inability of neutrophils to migrate to sites of infection or tissue damage. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency."}
{"question": "When studying the rate of multiplication of the hepatitis C virus in hepatocytes using a formaldehyde agarose gel, what type of molecular structure is most likely being identified after isolating the viral genomic material, enzymatically cleaving it, and applying targeted probes visualized under x-ray?", "gold_answer": "The molecular structure most likely being identified in this study is the viral RNA of the hepatitis C virus. Starting with the isolation of the viral genomic material, which is RNA, and proceeding through enzymatic cleavage and visualization using targeted probes, typically aligns with analyzing RNA sequences. The use of formaldehyde in agarose gel further supports this focus, as it is specifically employed to maintain RNA integrity during electrophoresis. The process outlined is indicative of northern blotting techniques, which are employed to detect specific RNA sequences within a sample. Therefore, the study is focusing on characterizing and quantifying the viral RNA to understand the hepatitis C virus multiplication rate within hepatocytes."}
{"question": "What symptoms are not typically associated with acute papilloedema?", "gold_answer": "Symptoms that are not typically associated with acute papilloedema include numbness, motor disturbances, isolated hearing changes, seizures, and unilateral visual changes. While papilloedema mainly involves symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure and visual disturbances, these other symptoms would suggest considering additional or alternative diagnoses."}
{"question": "A 29-year-old pregnant primigravida in her fourth month, with a history of Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, has been regularly taking sodium valproate and is seeking an opinion for her anti-epileptic regimen. What would be the recommended course of action for her epilepsy treatment during pregnancy?", "gold_answer": "Given the situation you've described, it's crucial to address the treatment regimen for her Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy during pregnancy due to the risk associated with sodium valproate. Sodium valproate is known for a higher risk of birth defects, including neural tube defects, and should generally be avoided during pregnancy unless no safer alternatives are effective.\n\nFor this pregnant woman, transitioning to alternative anti-epileptic medications that have a safer profile during pregnancy is advisable. Two commonly considered options are lamotrigine and levetiracetam. Both have shown better safety profiles in pregnant populations and are less associated with teratogenic effects compared to sodium valproate.\n\nIt's essential that this transition be managed carefully by a neurologist or an epileptologist. Changing epilepsy medications involves gradual titration to prevent breakthrough seizures, which can be harmful to both the mother and the developing fetus. During this process, close monitoring of seizure control and medication levels is important, as physiological changes during pregnancy can affect drug metabolism, which might require dose adjustments.\n\nIn summary, the recommended course of action is to consult with a specialist to potentially switch from sodium valproate to a medication like lamotrigine or levetiracetam, ensuring careful management and regular monitoring throughout the pregnancy to maintain optimal seizure control and minimize risks to the fetus."}
{"question": "What is one feature that cannot be used to differentiate between ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia?", "gold_answer": "One feature that cannot be used to differentiate between ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the heart rate, especially when it is greater than 160 beats per minute. Both VT and SVT can present with similar heart rates, and this parameter alone does not reliably distinguish between the two types of tachycardia."}
{"question": "A person involved in a road accident transiently lost consciousness, regained it, but then became unconscious again. What type of brain hemorrhage is most likely associated with this pattern of consciousness change?", "gold_answer": "The pattern of transient loss of consciousness, followed by a lucid interval, and then a subsequent decline into unconsciousness is most commonly associated with an epidural hematoma. This type of brain hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding between the dura mater (the outer protective covering of the brain) and the skull, often due to a traumatic injury. The initial impact can cause a person to lose consciousness, and as the blood begins to accumulate, there is typically a temporary period where they regain consciousness and seem alert. However, as the pressure on the brain increases due to the continuous bleeding, the person's condition can rapidly deteriorate, resulting in loss of consciousness again. This classic sequence of events is a key indicator of an epidural hematoma."}
{"question": "A 39-year-old woman, gravida 5, para 4, at 41 weeks' gestation, is experiencing regular uterine contractions with a history of iron deficiency anemia treated with supplements. After initial management including repositioning, oxygen therapy, and amnioinfusion, her cervix is 90% effaced and 7-cm dilated, with the vertex at -1 station. There are no changes in the fetal heart tracing, and she has less than 5 contractions in 10 minutes. What is the most appropriate next step in management for her delivery?", "gold_answer": "In this scenario, the woman is in active labor but it appears to be progressing slowly, as indicated by the dilation and the position of the baby's head. Although the contractions are regular, their frequency is relatively low for this phase of labor. Since there are no signs of fetal distress and interventions like repositioning, oxygen therapy, and amnioinfusion have not accelerated the labor's progress, the most appropriate next step is to augment labor.\n\nAdministering oxytocin could help increase the frequency and strength of the contractions, promoting further cervical dilation and descent of the baby's head. This approach is typically safe, especially given that she has not undergone prior cesarean deliveries or uterine surgeries that might increase the risk of complications from oxytocin use. It's important to continue close monitoring of both maternal and fetal well-being during oxytocin administration.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable step in this situation would be to begin oxytocin administration to enhance the labor process."}
{"question": "What is the most likely diagnosis for a 36-year-old multigravida at 34 weeks, with previous two normal vaginal deliveries, now presenting with an unstable lie?", "gold_answer": "Given the scenario you've described, the most likely diagnosis for a 36-year-old multigravida at 34 weeks with an unstable lie is polyhydramnios. A history of multiple pregnancies can indeed result in a more relaxed uterine musculature, potentially allowing increased fetal movement. Polyhydramnios, or an excessive amount of amniotic fluid, can further facilitate this by providing the fetus with additional room to move. However, your consideration of placenta previa is also valid since it could influence fetal positioning, but the likelihood of continuous repositioining in an unstable lie is more commonly associated with abnormal amounts of amniotic fluid. Therefore, polyhydramnios stands out as the most likely factor contributing to the unstable lie in this context."}
{"question": "A resident doctor sustained a needle stick injury while sampling blood of a patient who is HIV positive. A decision is taken to offer him post-exposure prophylaxis. Which one of the following would be the best recommendation?\nA. Zidovudine + Lamivudine for 4 weeks\nB. Zidovudine + Lamivudine + Nevirapine for 4 weeks\nC. Zidovudine + Lamivudine + Indinavir for 4 weeks\nD. Zidovudine + Stavudine + Nevirapine for 4 weeks.", "gold_answer": "Based on the options provided, the best recommendation for the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen in this scenario would be Option C: Zidovudine + Lamivudine + Indinavir for 4 weeks. Although not perfectly aligned with current guidelines that typically prefer the inclusion of integrase inhibitors for better tolerability and efficacy, this option follows the older, more traditional three-drug regimen approach, offering a combination that provides a broader range of antiretroviral drug classes, which is generally preferred over two-drug regimens."}
{"question": "In a 25-year-old woman experiencing hypertension, proteinuria, and pitting edema in the second month of her first pregnancy, what condition is the pathogenesis of her symptoms most closely associated with?", "gold_answer": "In this scenario, the symptoms of hypertension, proteinuria, and pitting edema occurring so early in a pregnancy—specifically within the first couple of months—are most closely associated with a molar pregnancy. This condition, part of gestational trophoblastic disease, involves an abnormal proliferation of trophoblastic tissue leading to elevated levels of beta-hCG. The pathological growth can cause early-onset symptoms similar to preeclampsia due to the disruption of normal placental development and hormonal imbalances, even though they manifest much earlier than typical pregnancy-related hypertension disorders."}
{"question": "A 6-month-old infant girl is brought by her parents to the emergency room due to abnormal jerky movements of the upper and lower limbs for the past month. When questioned about her birth history, the parents mention that a prenatal scan of the fetal heart revealed that the patient had a mass in the left ventricle, which led to the diagnosis of a neurocutaneous disorder in the child. Which of the following findings is a characteristic cutaneous finding associated with this young patient’s disorder?\nA. Ash-leaf spots\nB. Cafe-au-lait spots\nC. Cavernous hemangioma of the skin\nD.

{"question": "A 92-year-old woman was found to have amyloid deposition in her atria at autopsy, originating from a specific peptide. This peptide had a physiological role before deposition. What function was associated with this peptide?", "gold_answer": "The peptide in question is atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Before its deposition as amyloid in the atria, ANP plays a crucial physiological role in regulating blood pressure and maintaining fluid balance. It achieves this by promoting vasodilation, which widens blood vessels, and by increasing the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys. This leads to a reduction in blood pressure and helps manage the fluid levels in the body."}
{"question": "A newborn has a swelling in neck due to soft cystic mass with trans-illumination test positive. Diagnosis is?\nA. Potato tumor\nB. Branchial cyst\nC. Cystic hygroma\nD. Carotid body tumor", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for a newborn with a swelling in the neck characterized as a soft cystic mass that is trans-illumination positive is Cystic hygroma. Cystic hygromas are lymphatic malformations often occurring in the neck region and fit the description given. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is:\n\nC. Cystic hygroma"}
{"question": "What hormone is produced by the alpha cells in the pancreatic islets?", "gold_answer": "Alpha cells in the pancreatic islets produce the hormone glucagon. Glucagon plays a crucial role in blood glucose regulation by signaling the liver to convert glycogen into glucose and release it into the bloodstream, particularly when the body's blood sugar levels are low."}
{"question": "A 51-year-old man experiences progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and fatigue over two months. Examination and test results include cardiac exam without murmurs, coarse crackles at lung bases, an ECG with an irregularly irregular rhythm and absent p waves, a chest x-ray showing globular cardiac shadow enlargement with prominent hila and bilateral fluffy infiltrates, and echocardiography indicating a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 40%. What is the most likely cause of this patient's cardiac condition?", "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation and investigation findings suggest that this 51-year-old man is experiencing heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, likely due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His irregularly irregular ECG rhythm with absent p waves indicates chronic atrial fibrillation, which could have led to structural changes in the heart over time. This would account for the dilated left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction observed in the echocardiogram. The presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases and fluffy infiltrates on the chest x-ray further supports heart failure as a result of this cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the most probable cause of this patient's cardiac condition is chronic atrial fibrillation leading to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy."}
{"question": "A 13-year-old girl develops two non-tender lesions on her fingers that are slightly raised, pebbly-surfaced, and gray-white in appearance. Given that these lesions gradually disappear over the next 18 months, what is the most likely factor involved in the pathogenesis of these lesions?", "gold_answer": "The most likely factor involved in the pathogenesis of these lesions is an infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is known to cause warts, which are benign skin growths that often appear as raised, pebbly, and gray-white lesions—similar to what you described. Warts are caused when the virus infects the outer layer of the skin, leading to the proliferation of the skin cells. The timeline of 18 months for these lesions disappearing is consistent with the natural resolution of warts as the immune system eventually recognizes and clears the viral infection."}
{"question": "A 54-year-old man presents with progressive difficulty walking over the past 3 months, becoming wheelchair-bound, along with urinary incontinence for the past year. His speech has become slurred, he exhibits orthostatic hypotension, is oriented to person and place but not to time, and shows mild hand tremor and rigidity in limbs during a neurological examination. He is also unable to perform repetitive rotary forearm movements. Based on these clinical findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the provided clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis for the 54-year-old man is Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). His symptoms include a combination of Parkinsonian features such as tremor and rigidity, autonomic dysfunctions like urinary incontinence and orthostatic hypotension, as well as slurred speech and impaired coordination, particularly with repetitive movements. These align well with the mixed presentation of MSA, which encompasses both Parkinsonism and autonomic failure, differentiating it from classic Parkinson’s Disease. MSA is known for its rapidly progressing nature and variety of symptoms affecting multiple bodily systems, which matches the description of his condition."}
{"question": "An HIV patient presents with malabsorption, fever, chronic diarrhea, and tests positive for an acid-fast organism. What is the causative agent responsible for these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The causative agent responsible for the symptoms of malabsorption, fever, chronic diarrhea, and testing positive for an acid-fast organism in this HIV patient is likely Isospora belli. This parasite is known to cause such gastrointestinal symptoms in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS, and can be identified with a modified acid-fast stain."}

All of the following drugs need modification in doses except\nA. Isoniazid\nB. Streptomycin\nC. Rifamipicin\nD. Ethambutol", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided, rifampicin is the drug that does not require modification in dosage despite impaired renal function. In patients with chronic kidney disease, such as the described case with a creatinine clearance of 25 ml/min, rifampicin can generally be administered at the standard dose. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Rifampicin"}
{"question": "A 51-year-old man presents with decreased vibratory sense in his lower limbs, a widened pulse pressure, and a decrescendo murmur after the S2 heart sound. He also reports a past experience of a maculopapular rash on his trunk, palms, and soles that resolved spontaneously. In order to confirm the suspected diagnosis, what is the first test the physician performed?", "gold_answer": "To confirm the suspected diagnosis of syphilis in this patient, given the combination of symptoms and history, the first test that the physician would typically perform is a non-treponemal test. This would be either the Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test or the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test. These initial screening tests for syphilis help detect the presence of antibodies produced in response to the Treponema pallidum infection and are crucial for both establishing initial diagnosis and monitoring treatment effectiveness."}
{"question": "The ECG of a 40 year old male was recorded using standard bipolar limb leads. The sum of the voltage of the three standard leads was found to be 5 millivolts. This indicates:\nA. A normal heart\nB. Right ventricular hypertrophy\nC. Left ventricular hypertrophy\nD. Increased cardiac muscle mass", "gold_answer": "The sum of the voltages across the three standard bipolar limb leads in an ECG for a 40-year-old male being 5 millivolts indicates an abnormal finding. Normally, by Einthoven's law, this sum should be zero. A non-zero sum can suggest increased electrical activity within the heart, often due to an increase in cardiac muscle mass. This increase can be attributed to conditions like right or left ventricular hypertrophy, where the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thus generating stronger ECG signals.\n\nWhile the specific chamber of hypertrophy (right or left) isn't specified here, the overall increased voltage suggests a general increase in cardiac muscle mass. Therefore, based on the information given, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nD. Increased cardiac muscle mass"}
{"question": "What is the diagnosis for a 15 cm hyperpigmented macule on an adolescent male that undergoes changes such as coarseness, growth of hair, and development of acne?", "gold_answer": "The changes described—a 15 cm hyperpigmented macule on an adolescent male that becomes coarse, sprouts hair, and develops acne—are consistent with Becker's nevus. Becker's nevus typically appears during adolescence and is characterized by increased pigmentation, hair growth, and sometimes acneiform changes. It's more common in males and usually doesn’t require treatment unless desired for cosmetic reasons."}
{"question": "How is an episiotomy classified when the tear extends through the sphincter of the rectum but the rectal mucosa remains intact during delivery?", "gold_answer": "An episiotomy that extends through the sphincter of the rectum but does not affect the rectal mucosa is classified as a third-degree tear. This classification is used because the tear involves the anal sphincter while stopping short of the rectal mucosa. If the tear had extended into the rectal mucosa, it would be considered a fourth-degree tear, which is more severe. Therefore, in the scenario you described, it aligns with a third-degree classification."}
{"question": "A 45-year-old construction worker presents with a painful and swollen wrist joint, and joint aspiration shows needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals under polarized light microscopy. What is the most likely diagnosis based on these findings?", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 45-year-old construction worker, based on the symptoms of a painful and swollen wrist and the presence of needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals under polarized light microscopy, is gout. These crystals are consistent with monosodium urate, which are characteristic of gout, a common form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden and severe episodes of pain, redness, and swelling in joints."}
{"question": "Explain the physiological changes that characterize somatic death.", "gold_answer": "Somatic death occurs when the body’s physiological systems irreversibly cease functioning, marking the end of biological life. This process involves a sequence of changes that reflect the cessation of critical systems and the subsequent biological decomposition.\n\nInitially, death involves the halt of vital functions: the heart stops beating (cardiac arrest), the brain stops functioning (cerebral death), and respiration ceases (pulmonary arrest). With the loss of these functions, the body can no longer circulate oxygen and nutrients to its tissues, leading to cellular death.\n\nOne of the first observable changes after somatic death is algor mortis, the cooling of the body. This happens because metabolic processes cease, and the body starts to equilibrate with the ambient temperature. The rate of cooling can vary based on environmental conditions and the physical characteristics of the body.\n\nNext comes rigor mortis, the stiffening of muscles. This occurs because ATP, necessary for muscle relaxation, is no longer produced after death. Without ATP, the actin and myosin fibers in muscles remain bound, causing rigidity. Rigor mortis typically begins a few hours after death and can persist for up to 72 hours.\n\nLivor mortis follows, characterized by the settling of blood in the lower parts of the body due to gravity. This causes a purplish discoloration of the skin in those areas. This process starts soon after death and can provide clues about the position of the body at the time of death.\n\nFinally, decomposition sets in. This involves autolysis, where cells begin to break down due to enzymatic activity, and putrefaction, driven by bacterial activity. As decomposition progresses, gases are produced, and tissues break down, leading to further physical and chemical changes to the body.\n\nCollectively, these changes, from the ceasing of vital functions to decomposition, represent the physiological characteristics of somatic death, signifying the transition from a biologically active state to one of natural decay."}
{"question": "In combination birth control pills, how does the estrogenic component primarily contribute to the contraceptive effect?", "gold_answer": "In combination birth control pills, the estrogen component primarily contributes to the contraceptive effect by suppressing the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. This suppression of FSH prevents the maturation of ovarian follicles, thereby reducing the likelihood of ovulation occurring. Without ovulation, there is no egg available for fertilization, which is crucial for pregnancy prevention. While estrogen plays this supportive role, it works effectively alongside progestin, which handles additional mechanisms like preventing ovulation directly, thickening cervical mucus, and altering the uterine lining. Together, they form an efficient contraceptive strategy."}
{"question": "Following a thyroidectomy, a patient experiences neck swelling and difficulty breathing on the same evening post-surgery. What is the immediate next step in management to prevent airway compromise?", "gold_answer": "In the scenario described, the immediate next step in management to prevent airway compromise is to release the sutures at the surgical site. This action is critical to alleviating pressure from a postoperative hematoma, which is the most likely cause of the neck swelling and breathing difficulty following a thyroidectomy. Promptly releasing the sutures can effectively relieve the pressure, reduce swelling, and help prevent further airway obstruction, thereby addressing the root cause of the symptoms."}
{"question": "A 70 kg, 34-year-old athlete underwent an emergency laparotomy using intermittent doses of succinylcholine totaling 640 mg, due to the non-availability of vecuronium bromide. After surgery, the patient exhibited no respiratory movements and was unable to move his limbs. What is the cause of this post-operative paralysis?", "gold_answer": "The most likely cause of this post-operative paralysis is **pseudocholinesterase deficiency**.\n\nSuccinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker commonly used for rapid sequence intubation due to its rapid onset and short duration of action. Normally, succinylcholine is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase (also known as butyrylcholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase) into inactive metabolites. However, in individuals with pseudocholinesterase deficiency, the enzyme is either absent, present in reduced quantities, or dysfunctional. This results in delayed metabolism of succinylcholine, leading to prolonged neuromuscular blockade and extended paralysis.\n\nIn this case, the patient received a total of 640 mg of succinylcholine, which is an unusually high dose for a 70 kg individual (typical dose is approximately 1 mg/kg, or 70 mg). With such a large dose, even a mild deficiency in pseudocholinesterase activity could result in significant drug accumulation and prolonged paralysis. The patient’s lack of respiratory movements and inability to move their limbs post-operatively strongly indicate persistent neuromuscular blockade, consistent with this enzyme deficiency.\n\nPseudocholinesterase deficiency can be inherited (genetic) or acquired. Genetic forms are often due to mutations in the BCHE gene, while acquired forms can result from liver disease, malnutrition, pregnancy, or certain medications. Regardless of the cause, the clinical outcome in this context is the same: succinylcholine remains active for much longer than expected.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, pseudocholinesterase activity in the patient’s blood can be measured. If the enzyme activity is deficient, appropriate supportive care should be provided until the drug is metabolized and normal neuromuscular function is restored. Mechanical ventilation should be continued until the patient regains the ability to breathe independently."}
{"question": "Identify the substances from the following list that are not typically associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia: Prostaglandins E, Norepinephrine, Ascorbic acid, 5-HT.", "gold_answer": "The substances that are not typically associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia from the list provided are prostaglandins E and ascorbic acid."}
{"question": "A 30-year-old female presents with a 3-month history of 10kg weight loss despite an increased appetite. She also complains of anxiety, diarrhea, and amenorrhea. Examination reveals a fine tremor, brisk reflexes, and a systolic murmur heard throughout the precordium. A urine pregnancy screen was negative. Based on these clinical findings, what is the most likely finding on examining her pulse?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical findings and symptoms described, the most likely finding on examining her pulse would be an \"irregularly irregular\" pulse. This pattern is characteristic of atrial fibrillation, which can occur as a complication of hyperthyroidism due to the increased cardiovascular demand and sympathetic activity associated with this condition."}
{"question": "What is the term for the time interval between diagnosis by early detection through screening and diagnosis by other conventional means?", "gold_answer": "The term you're looking for is \"lead time.\" Lead time refers to the interval between the early detection of a disease through screening and the point at which the diagnosis would have been made by conventional means, such as when symptoms become apparent. This concept is central to understanding the potential benefits of screening, as earlier diagnosis can sometimes lead to more effective treatment options."}
{"question": "A 55-year-old man with a 30-pack-year smoking history presents with worsening chronic cough and lower limb swelling, developing drowsiness after receiving oxygen therapy. Which specific receptors' dysfunction led to his condition, given the central cyanosis and expiratory wheezes observed during his examination?", "gold_answer": "The patient's drowsiness after oxygen therapy is likely due to the dysfunction of peripheral chemoreceptors. In individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where there is a history of chronic CO2 retention, the body's reliance on low oxygen levels to stimulate breathing becomes more pronounced. Peripheral chemoreceptors, located in the carotid and aortic bodies, usually increase the drive to breathe when they detect low oxygen levels. However, when high levels of oxygen are administered, these chemoreceptors reduce their activity because they sense adequate oxygen, leading to a diminished respiratory drive. This results in decreased ventilation, further CO2 retention, and ultimately CO2 narcosis, which is causing the drowsiness observed in this patient. Therefore, it's the alteration in the function of the peripheral chemoreceptors in response to oxygen therapy that has led to his condition."}
{"question": "What is the most probable cause of a regular heart rate of 60 beats per minute in a patient with chronic atrial fibrillation?", "gold_answer": "The most probable cause of a regular heart rate of 60 beats per minute in a patient with chronic atrial fibrillation is likely digitalis toxicity. Digitalis can slow down the conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, which may lead to a form of heart block where the chaotic impulses from the atria are not properly conducted to the ventricles. This can result in the ventricles maintaining a regular rhythm even in the presence of atrial fibrillation. This regularization of the heart rate due to slowed AV conduction is consistent with the effects of digitalis toxicity and is a known presentation that can mimic a more stable heart rhythm despite the underlying atrial dysrhythmia."}
{"question": "A 6-year-old child is brought to the emergency department with a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhea. Upon examination, the child appears drowsy, has sunken eyes, hypothermia, and the skin takes time to retract after being pinched. Based on these symptoms, what is the diagnosis regarding the child's hydration status?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms described, the child is experiencing severe dehydration. The combination of drowsiness, sunken eyes, hypothermia, and skin tenting strongly indicates that the hydration status is critically low. Immediate medical intervention with fluid replacement is essential to address this condition and prevent any further complications."}
{"question": "What effect does a substance that competes with acetylcholine (ACh) for receptors at the motor end plate have on skeletal muscle function?", "gold_answer": "A substance that competes with acetylcholine for receptors at the motor end plate acts as a competitive antagonist. By occupying the binding sites on nicotinic receptors without activating them, this substance prevents acetylcholine from binding and triggering muscle contraction. Consequently, skeletal muscle function is inhibited, leading to muscle weakness or paralysis because the signal for the muscle to contract is effectively blocked."}
{"question": "42 year old obese patient comes with gallstones. She is on cholesterol lowering drugs and her weight is reduced 10 kgs in the last month. What might be the cause for gallstones\nA. Obesity\nB. Cholesterol lowering drugs\nC. Rapid weight loss\nD. All of the above", "gold_answer": "The most comprehensive answer here would be D. All of the above. Obesity is a well-known risk factor for gallstones due to increased cholesterol production by the liver, which can lead to bile cholesterol saturation. Rapid weight loss, such as losing 10 kg in a month, can also trigger the formation of gallstones because the liver releases more cholesterol into the bile during fast weight loss, increasing the risk of stone formation. Additionally, while cholesterol-lowering drugs primarily aim to reduce blood cholesterol, some can alter bile composition in ways that may contribute to gallstone development. Therefore, it's likely a combination of obesity, recent rapid weight loss, and possibly the cholesterol-lowering medications that are contributing to the development of gallstones in this patient."}
{"question": "What is the rate at which levonorgestrel is released into the uterus from the Mirena intrauterine device?", "gold_answer": "The Mirena intrauterine device releases levonorgestrel at an initial rate of approximately 20 micrograms per day. Over time, this rate gradually decreases, but the device is designed to remain effective in its contraceptive function for up to five years. This controlled release mechanism ensures a consistent delivery of the hormone to achieve its intended purpose of preventing pregnancy."}
{"question": "In a patient with a head injury who shows eye opening with painful stimulus, localizes pain, and has an inappropriate verbal response, what is the total score on the Glasgow Coma Scale?", "gold_answer": "The total score on the Glasgow Coma Scale for a patient who shows eye opening with painful stimulus, localizes pain, and has an inappropriate verbal response is 10. This is calculated as follows: eye response of 2 (eye opening to pain), motor response of 5 (localizes pain), and a verbal response of 3 (inappropriate verbal response)."}
{"question": "What is the most appropriate management for a chronic alcoholic with abdominal pain radiating to the back, a dilated pancreatic duct, and stones in the tail of the pancreas?", "gold_answer": "For a chronic alcoholic with abdominal pain radiating to the back, a dilated pancreatic duct, and stones in the tail of the pancreas, the most appropriate management would likely involve surgical intervention. Given the location of the stones and the chronic nature of the issue, procedures such as a distal pancreatectomy or a Puestow procedure (lateral pancreaticojejunostomy) could be considered. These surgical options are aimed at effectively relieving ductal pressure and alleviating pain when less invasive methods, such as endoscopic removal, may not be feasible or successful due to the stone's location in the pancreatic tail."}
{"question": "Given a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome experiencing severe diarrhea along with low gastric acid secretion and a normal gastrin level, which serum assay should be evaluated to determine the possible cause of the diarrhea?", "gold_answer": "In this scenario, it would be advisable to evaluate the serum levels of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The symptoms you’ve described, particularly the severe watery diarrhea, low gastric acid secretion (achlorhydria), and normal gastrin levels, align well with a condition known as VIPoma. VIPomas, which can occur in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome, secrete excessive amounts of VIP, leading to such symptoms. By measuring the levels of VIP in the serum, you can confirm or rule out a VIPoma as the underlying cause of the diarrhea."}
{"question": "A 4-year-old boy presents with a rapidly spreading itchy rash after eating shellfish, characterized by erythematous, raised macules that blanch with pressure, and without systemic symptoms. Given this clinical presentation, what is the most appropriate treatment for managing this condition?", "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation of the 4-year-old boy suggests he is experiencing urticaria, commonly known as hives, likely triggered by shellfish consumption. Since there are no systemic symptoms, such as difficulty breathing that would suggest a severe allergic reaction like anaphylaxis, the most appropriate treatment is to address the itching and swelling of the rash. \n\nIn this situation, administering a non-sedating oral antihistamine is the recommended course of action. Antihistamines help counteract the effects of histamines that lead to the itchy, raised rash characteristic of hives. For a child of this age, a non-drowsy antihistamine such as loratadine or cetirizine is preferred to avoid the sedative side effects associated with first-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine. These medications are effective at alleviating symptoms and generally well-tolerated in young children.\n\nTherefore, starting the boy on a non-sedating antihistamine like loratadine would be the most appropriate and effective treatment for managing his hives."}
{"question": "What is inaccurate about pertussis regarding maternal antibody protection in infants and the impact on males and females?", "gold_answer": "The inaccuracies regarding pertussis involve two main points: maternal antibody protection in infants and the impact on males and females. \n\nFirst, the notion that maternal antibodies provide sufficient protection against pertussis for infants is inaccurate. While maternal antibodies can offer some level of protection, they generally are not enough to prevent pertussis in infants. This underscores the need for timely vaccination to ensure infants are adequately protected against the disease.\n\nSecond, the belief that pertussis affects males and females differently in a significant way is incorrect. Pertussis affects both boys and girls relatively equally, without notable differences in risk or severity based on gender. Therefore, assumptions about gender-specific impacts of pertussis are not supported by evidence. \n\nThese points highlight the importance of not relying solely on maternal immunity and ensuring all infants receive the appropriate vaccinations to protect against pertussis, irrespective of gender."}
{"question": "Based on the patient's comprehensive history and examination summary, which cardiovascular structure is this 44-year-old male most at risk of sustaining damage to, given the symptoms of increased thirst, frequent urination, weakness, joint pain, and hyperpigmentation?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms described, particularly the electrolyte imbalances related to potential Addison's disease, the 44-year-old male is most at risk of sustaining damage to the heart's conduction system. The high potassium levels associated with Addison's disease can disrupt the electrical signals required for proper heart rhythm, increasing the risk of arrhythmias. This makes the conduction system of the heart a primary cardiovascular structure at risk under these circumstances."}
{"question": "In which condition will the delivery of the aftercoming head of a breech presentation not face difficulty?", "gold_answer": "In the delivery of the aftercoming head of a breech presentation, difficulties are minimized when several key conditions are met: the cervix is fully dilated, the maternal pelvis is adequately sized, the baby's head is flexed (meaning the chin is tucked in), and the baby's size is appropriate for the maternal birth canal. These conditions allow for a smoother and safer passage of the baby's head. Additionally, regular monitoring and the readiness to employ maneuvers or interventions, if necessary, can further facilitate the delivery process."}
{"question": "A patient is unable to flex the distal interphalangeal joints of the fourth and fifth fingers and cannot hold a card between fingers. At which anatomical site might a fracture have occurred, damaging the nerve responsible for these clinical features?", "gold_answer": "The clinical features described suggest an issue with the ulnar nerve. The inability to flex the distal interphalangeal joints of the fourth and fifth fingers indicates a problem with the ulnar nerve innervation of the flexor digitorum profundus. Additionally, the inability to hold a card between the fingers points toward issues with the intrinsic hand muscles, such as the adductor pollicis and the interosseous muscles, which are also innervated by the ulnar nerve.\n\nThese symptoms align with ulnar nerve compression or injury, typically occurring at the wrist in Guyon's canal. A fracture around this area could compromise the ulnar nerve, leading to the specific hand symptoms observed.\n\nTherefore, a fracture likely occurred at the wrist, affecting Guyon's canal and compromising the ulnar nerve, resulting in the described clinical features."}
{"question": "Given the description of a 15-year-old girl who has yet to experience menarche, with a physical examination noting a Tanner 4 stage of development for her breast, genitalia, and pubic hair, what specific breast development finding would you expect to observe in this patient?", "gold_answer": "In Tanner stage 4 of breast development, you would expect to observe the formation of a secondary mound on the breast due to the projection of the areola and nipple. This stage is characterized by the areola and nipple forming a distinct mound above the contour of the breast, which is a typical finding for someone who is in Tanner stage 4."}
{"question": "In a case where a previously healthy 18-year-old woman presents with intractable vomiting, uterine cramping, and a serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin concentration of 170,000 mIU/mL, alongside a transvaginal ultrasound indicating a complex intrauterine mass with numerous anechoic spaces and multiple ovarian cysts, and dilation and curettage showing hydropic villi with diffuse, circumferential trophoblastic proliferation, what is the most likely karyotype analysis result from the specimen derived from this condition?", "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation and findings strongly suggest a complete molar pregnancy. In complete moles, the most common karyotype is 46,XX, resulting from an enucleated egg being fertilized by a single sperm, which then duplicates its genetic material. This scenario aligns perfectly with the clinical context described. Therefore, the most likely karyotype analysis result for this condition is 46,XX."}
{"question": "A 28-year-old man presents with anterior lenticonus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). His maternal uncle had a similar illness and passed away. What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 28-year-old man presenting with anterior lenticonus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), alongside a family history suggestive of maternal inheritance, is Alport syndrome. Alport syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities, including anterior lenticonus. It is often linked to mutations in the COL4A5 gene on the X chromosome, fitting the pattern of X-linked inheritance suggested by the family history."}
{"question": "What specific disadvantage is associated with the Marshall Marchetti Krantz procedure when compared to other surgical options for treating stress urinary incontinence?", "gold_answer": "The Marshall Marchetti Krantz (MMK) procedure specifically carries the risk of causing osteitis pubis, an inflammation condition, due to its method of attachment to the pubic bone. This risk is a distinct disadvantage compared to other surgical options for treating stress urinary incontinence, such as Burch colposuspension or sling procedures, which do not typically involve fixation to the pubic bone. The MMK’s approach to suspending the bladder neck can lead to this unique complication, in addition to other general postoperative risks like urinary dysfunction, making it less favored, especially with the advent of less invasive techniques."}
{"question": "During which specific tooth extraction is displacement of a root into the maxillary sinus most likely to occur?", "gold_answer": "During the extraction of the maxillary first molar, there is the highest likelihood of a root being displaced into the maxillary sinus. This tooth's roots are often in close proximity to the maxillary sinus, making them especially prone to such incidents during extraction."}
{"question": "A 26-year-old female presents with a small, round bluish nodule on her index nail bed that is painful and exhibits increased pain on exposure to cold, along with increased pin-prick sensitivity. What is the most probable diagnosis for this presentation?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms described, the most probable diagnosis for the 26-year-old female's condition is a glomus tumor. Glomus tumors are typically small, benign vascular tumors that occur commonly under the nails. They often present with symptoms like sharp pain, sensitivity to cold temperatures, and increased sensitivity to touch, which aligns closely with the patient's experiences. The bluish appearance of the nodule under the nail bed also matches the typical characteristics of a glomus tumor, as they are related to blood vessels. Therefore, considering the provided symptoms and their classic presentation, a glomus tumor is the likely diagnosis."}
{"question": "During a study on systolic heart failure, an investigator identified a hormone released by ventricular cardiomyocytes in response to increased wall stress. What intracellular mechanism does this hormone use that is most similar to the effect of a particular substance known for its role in vasodilation, particularly related to heart failure?", "gold_answer": "The hormone identified by the investigator is B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), which is released from ventricular cardiomyocytes in response to increased wall stress. BNP uses an intracellular mechanism involving the activation of an enzyme called guanylyl cyclase. This activation leads to an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a secondary messenger molecule. The effects of BNP are similar to those of nitric oxide, a substance well-known for its role in vasodilation, particularly related to heart failure. Both BNP and nitric oxide increase cGMP levels within cells, leading to the relaxation of smooth muscle cells in blood vessel walls and promoting vasodilation. Thus, BNP simulates the effect of nitric oxide by using a similar pathway—enhancing cGMP accumulation—to mitigate cardiovascular stress."}
{"question": "A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, a history of peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori infection, and vital signs indicative of shock, including a pulse of 120/min, a respiratory rate of 20/min, a temperature of 39°C, and a blood pressure of 90/50 mm Hg. Physical examination shows significant abdominal tenderness. A standing chest radiograph is performed. Given these findings, what is the next best step in the management of this patient?", "gold_answer": "Given the clinical presentation of severe abdominal pain, vital signs of shock, and a history of peptic ulcer disease, combined with the suspicion for perforated peptic ulcer possibly confirmed by free air under the diaphragm on a chest X-ray, the next best step in the management of this patient is to consult a surgical team urgently. This situation likely requires surgical intervention, such as exploratory laparotomy, to address a potential perforation in the gastrointestinal tract. Time is of the essence to stabilize the patient's condition and manage the suspected perforation effectively."}
{"question": "A 34-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of progressively blurred vision and reports seeing flashing lights in his visual field without any pain. Physical examination reveals right conjunctival injection and visual acuity of 20/100 in the right eye. The patient has a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 46/mm3. Based on these findings and the typical fundoscopic appearance associated with his condition, what is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for treating his eye condition?", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided, the patient is likely suffering from CMV retinitis, a common opportunistic infection in individuals with significantly low CD4+ T-cell counts like his. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as blurred vision, seeing flashing lights, and no associated pain, which aligns with the typical presentation of CMV retinitis. Additionally, the fundoscopy findings in CMV retinitis often show retinal changes resembling 'pizza pie' or 'cheese and ketchup' appearances.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for treating CMV retinitis in this scenario is oral valganciclovir. This medication is effective and convenient, making it a common choice in treating this eye condition to protect the patient's vision."}
{"question": "If motile spermatozoa are found in a wet mount of vaginal secretions, what does this indicate about the timeframe of intercourse?", "gold_answer": "If motile spermatozoa are found in a wet mount of vaginal secretions, it indicates that intercourse likely occurred recently, typically within the past 12 to 48 hours. The presence of active, moving sperm suggests that they were introduced into the female reproductive tract at a time when they could still maintain their motility and energy, which generally diminishes after the first couple of days post-intercourse."}
{"question": "What condition is indicated by a 5-year-old child developing an End Tidal CO2 of 0 mm Hg and a PO2 of 80 mm Hg during a sitting craniotomy?", "gold_answer": "The scenario you described, where a 5-year-old child undergoing a sitting craniotomy shows an End Tidal CO2 (ETCO2) of 0 mm Hg and a PO2 of 80 mm Hg, strongly suggests the development of a venous air embolism. During a sitting craniotomy, the position can expose veins to air, and if air enters the venous circulation, it can disrupt pulmonary circulation. This blockage prevents CO2 from reaching the exhalation monitor, causing the ETCO2 to drop to zero. At the same time, the PO2 level might not immediately show dramatic changes because enough oxygen may still circulate. The combination of the surgical position and the sudden loss of detected CO2 are key indicators of a venous air embolism in this context."}
{"question": "Given that kinky hair disease is characterized by peculiar white stubby hair, lack of growth, brain degeneration, and early death by age two, and considering that Mrs. A's two sisters had sons who died from this condition, along with her mother's brother having died from it as well, what is the most likely mode of inheritance for kinky hair disease in her family?", "gold_answer": "The most likely mode of inheritance for kinky hair disease in Mrs. A's family is X-linked recessive. This conclusion is based on the observed pattern where only males in the family are affected by the disease, while females appear to be carriers. In X-linked recessive disorders, males express the disease phenotype because they have only one X chromosome, and a single recessive allele on that chromosome can cause the condition. Females, with two X chromosomes, are typically carriers when only one of them carries the affected gene, resulting in no symptoms, which aligns with the family history described."}
{"question": "In cases of methyl alcohol poisoning, the effects such as CNS depression, cardiac depression, and optic nerve atrophy are attributed to which specific toxic metabolites?", "gold_answer": "In cases of methyl alcohol, or methanol, poisoning, the toxic effects such as CNS depression, cardiac depression, and optic nerve atrophy are primarily attributed to the metabolites formaldehyde and formate. Once methanol is metabolized in the body, it is first converted into formaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. Formaldehyde is then further metabolized into formate by formaldehyde dehydrogenase. The accumulation of formate is especially harmful, leading to metabolic acidosis, damage to the optic nerve, and impaired cellular respiration, ultimately causing the systemic effects associated with methanol poisoning."}
{"question": "A 66-year-old woman presented with symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats, and progressive shortness of breath, alongside findings of a diastolic murmur and vegetations on the aortic valve caused by S. gallolyticus. After treatment with antibiotics for her infective endocarditis, what is the most appropriate next step in her management to address a potential underlying condition?", "gold_answer": "After treating the 66-year-old woman's infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus, the most appropriate next step in her management is to perform a colonoscopy. S. gallolyticus is strongly associated with colorectal cancer and other colonic pathologies. Therefore, screening her colon is critical to identify or rule out any potential underlying malignant or precancerous conditions. Taking this step is essential to ensure comprehensive management of her health risks."}
{"question": "A 40-year-old alcoholic man undergoing treatment for tuberculosis shows non-compliance with medications and presents with symptoms of increasing weakness, fatigue, weight loss, nausea, hypotension, and hyperpigmentation in specific areas. What is the best next step to evaluate his condition given these clinical findings?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms and clinical findings, it is highly suggestive of Addison's disease, likely due to adrenal insufficiency potentially caused by his history of tuberculosis. To evaluate his condition accurately, the best next step is to perform an ACTH (cosyntropin) stimulation test. This test will help determine if his adrenal glands are able to produce adequate cortisol in response to ACTH stimulation, thereby confirming or ruling out primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease). Given his symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, hypotension, and hyperpigmentation, this is the most appropriate diagnostic test to pursue in this scenario."}
{"question": "A 54-year-old female with a history of hypertension and previous kidney stones presents with fatigue, constipation, and diffuse bone aches. Lab work shows hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia, along with an elevated parathyroid hormone level. What radiographic finding would most likely be observed in the bones of this patient’s hands given her condition?", "gold_answer": "In this clinical scenario indicative of primary hyperparathyroidism, the most likely radiographic finding in the bones of the patient’s hands would be subperiosteal bone resorption. This characteristic finding typically occurs on the radial aspects of the middle phalanges. The condition is driven by elevated parathyroid hormone levels, leading to increased bone resorption and the observed changes in calcium and phosphate levels. This radiographic evidence is a classic indication of the effects of primary hyperparathyroidism on bone density and structure."}
{"question": "What are two correct statements about mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma in terms of its predisposition and treatment sensitivity?", "gold_answer": "Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is notable for two key characteristics: \n\n1. Predisposition: MALT lymphoma often arises in settings where there is chronic inflammation or infection. A notable example is its association with Helicobacter pylori infection in the stomach, which can lead to gastric MALT lymphoma.\n\n2. Treatment Sensitivity: Unlike many other lymphomas that typically require chemotherapy, MALT lymphoma, especially when linked to Helicobacter pylori infection, can often be effectively treated with antibiotics targeting the underlying infection. Addressing the infection can cause the lymphoma to regress, due to the removal of the chronic inflammatory stimulus driving its growth. \n\nThese aspects make MALT lymphoma distinct in its development and treatment approach compared to other lymphomas."}
{"question": "During which stage of HIV infection does tuberculosis cause pulmonary disease resembling post primary disease in normal individuals?", "gold_answer": "Tuberculosis causes pulmonary disease that resembles post-primary TB in normal individuals during the early stages of HIV infection, particularly in the stage known as clinical latency or the early chronic stage of HIV. During this period, while the immune system is compromised, it still has sufficient capability to mount a response, leading to TB presentations that more closely mimic those seen in HIV-negative individuals, including classic lung cavitation. As HIV progresses to AIDS, and the immune system becomes severely weakened, TB manifests more atypically, often becoming disseminated rather than confined to the lungs."}
{"question": "What is the appropriate next step for a 27-year-old female who has a fixed idea that her nose is ugly, which is not shared by others, hides her face when going outside, and seeks plastic surgery?", "gold_answer": "The most appropriate next step for the woman is to consult with a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. Given that she is preoccupied with a perceived flaw that others don't notice and is engaging in behaviors like hiding her face, this situation might indicate Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). A mental health evaluation can help determine if BDD or another condition is present and guide her towards the right treatment.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is commonly recommended for BDD, as it can help her address and reframe the negative thought patterns related to her appearance. In some cases, medication might also be helpful. It's crucial that she explores these therapeutic options before considering any cosmetic surgery, as surgery may not address the underlying psychological issues. Prioritizing mental health treatment can lead to better long-term outcomes and improve her overall self-perception."}
{"question": "In the process of preparing fetal chromosomes for microscopic examination, which drug is used to arrest cell division in metaphase and is also utilized in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis?", "gold_answer": "The drug used to arrest cell division in metaphase for preparing fetal chromosomes for microscopic examination, and also utilized in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis, is colchicine."}
{"question": "Which muscle primarily acts as an evertor of the ankle and inserts into the medial cuneiform?", "gold_answer": "The muscle that primarily acts as an evertor of the ankle and inserts into the medial cuneiform is the peroneus longus. This muscle plays a key role in foot movement by stabilizing and everting the ankle, and its tendon specifically attaches to the medial cuneiform and the base of the first metatarsal."}
{"question": "A 23-year-old man presents with paroxysms of coughing followed by gasping for air. Despite being up to date on vaccinations and generally healthy, he has a temperature of 101.0°F, a pulse of 105/min, and a leukocyte count indicating lymphocytosis, with clear breath sounds on examination. Considering these findings, what is the best next step in the management of this patient?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms and findings you've described, it is highly suggestive of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough. Even though the patient is up to date on vaccinations, immunity can wane over time, which might explain the infection. Pertussis is highly contagious, and prompt treatment is essential not only for the affected individual but also to prevent its spread to others.\n\nThe best next step in managing this patient would be to start antibiotic treatment with azithromycin. Azithromycin is effective in treating Bordetella pertussis, the bacterium responsible for whooping cough, and helps reduce the duration of contagiousness, which is crucial in controlling the spread of the disease in the community. Initiating treatment promptly is important in cases where clinical suspicion is high, even before confirmatory test results return."}
{"question": "A newborn infant is born at 40 weeks gestation with no complications during pregnancy. The infant is displaying normal vital signs and spontaneous movement. What is the standard next step in newborn management to prevent both hemorrhagic disease of the newborn and ocular infections?", "gold_answer": "The standard next steps in newborn management to prevent hemorrhagic disease and ocular infections involve administering a vitamin K injection and applying an antibiotic ointment to the eyes. Specifically, a vitamin K injection is given to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, which is important for ensuring proper blood clotting. Additionally, erythromycin ointment is typically applied to the baby's eyes to prevent ocular infections that could be acquired during delivery. These steps are standard practice to help maintain the health and safety of a newborn."}
{"question": "A 27-year-old man presents with severe dyspnea and sharp chest pain that started suddenly after exercise. His right lung field is hyperresonant with diminished lung sounds on examination, and chest wall motion during respiration is asymmetrical. Considering these clinical findings, what is the best immediate management step for this patient?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical findings presented, the best immediate management step for this patient is to perform a chest tube thoracostomy. The symptoms of sudden dyspnea, sharp chest pain, hyperresonance, diminished breath sounds, and asymmetrical chest wall motion strongly suggest a pneumothorax, likely a primary spontaneous pneumothorax, given the patient's young age and the acute onset after exercise. Considering the severity of the symptoms, particularly the severe difficulty in breathing, a chest tube is necessary to promptly re-expand the lung and alleviate the patient's symptoms. This approach is crucial in effectively managing the situation and providing rapid relief."}
{"question": "In a case where a 16-year-old female presents with fever, swollen lymph nodes, and a papule shortly after starting work at a pet store, what is the vector of transmission for the causative agent of these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The vector of transmission for the causative agent, Bartonella henselae, in the symptoms described—fever, swollen lymph nodes, and a papule—is the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis. This flea can transmit the bacteria to cats, which can then lead to transmission to humans, often through a scratch or bite, resulting in Cat Scratch Disease."}

{"question": "A 65-year-old man presents with a vesicular rash along the T4 dermatome, accompanied by a burning and tingling pain, and stable vital signs. Considering these symptoms and his medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, what is the most appropriate antiviral medication to treat his condition and prevent further complications?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms described—a vesicular rash along the T4 dermatome with burning and tingling pain—suggest that this 65-year-old man is experiencing shingles, caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. In treating shingles, it's crucial to reduce the severity and duration of the rash and associated pain while minimizing the risk of complications like postherpetic neuralgia.\n\nConsidering his medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, it's important to choose a medication that's effective and has a convenient dosing schedule to promote adherence. Valacyclovir is a well-suited option in this scenario. It requires less frequent dosing than acyclovir, making it more manageable for the patient. Valacyclovir is dosed three times a day, which is beneficial for adherence and is highly effective in treating shingles.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate antiviral medication for this patient to treat his shingles and prevent further complications is valacyclovir."}
{"question": "In a 4-year-old boy presenting with involuntary jerks and chaotic eye movements, who has an abdominal mass in the left adrenal gland with increased urinary vanillylmandelic acid levels and neuroblasts arranged in a rosette pattern on biopsy, which oncogene is most commonly associated with neuroblastoma in this condition?", "gold_answer": "The oncogene most commonly associated with neuroblastoma, particularly in the condition you described, is MYCN. In neuroblastoma cases, MYCN amplification is a significant genetic marker and is often associated with poor prognosis. Your description of the symptoms and the specifics of the case align closely with the characteristics of neuroblastoma, making MYCN amplification a key factor in this scenario."}
{"question": "A 45-year-old male patient presents to the outpatient department with a 3-week history of cough and diarrhea. Upon diagnosis, he is found to be HIV positive with Tuberculosis. Considering the patient's co-infection, what should be the next step in his management?", "gold_answer": "In managing a patient who is co-infected with HIV and active Tuberculosis, the priority is to initiate treatment for Tuberculosis first. This is because TB is immediately life-threatening and requires prompt attention. The typical approach is to start anti-TB medications right away. Once TB treatment is underway and the patient begins to stabilize, Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for HIV should be introduced. The recommended timeline for starting ART is generally between 2 to 8 weeks after beginning TB treatment. This strategy helps in reducing the risk of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) while effectively managing both conditions. Therefore, the next step in this patient's management is to promptly start anti-TB treatment."}
{"question": "A 16-year-old girl presents with primary amenorrhea, short stature, a shield chest, and abdominal imaging suggests the presence of streak gonads. What karyotypes could be associated with her clinical presentation?", "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation of a 16-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, short stature, a shield chest, and streak gonads strongly suggests Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic condition affecting females where there is partial or complete loss of one of the X chromosomes or structural abnormalities of the X chromosome. The potential karyotypes associated with Turner syndrome that could match her presentation include:\n\n1. **45,X**: This is the classic karyotype where there is a complete absence of one X chromosome.\n2. **45,X/46,XX** or **45,X/46,XY**: These are examples of mosaic karyotypes, where the individual has two different cell lines; one with monosomy X and the other with a normal female or male karyotype.\n3. **Structural abnormalities of the X chromosome**, such as:\n   - **Isochromosome Xq (46,X,i(Xq))**: Where the long arm of the X chromosome is duplicated.\n   - **Ring X chromosome (46,X,r(X))**: Where the ends of the X chromosome are fused to form a circular structure.\n   - **X chromosome deletions or rearrangements**: Leading to similar Turner-like features.\n\nThese variations can give rise to a spectrum of physical features and clinical presentations as observed in your case. Therefore, any of these karyotypes could be associated with her clinical symptoms."}
{"question": "A 32-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of frequent, watery diarrhea, mild abdominal pain, and flushing episodes. He has a history of similar episodes over the past year and recently returned from a trip to Nigeria. Examination reveals dry mucous membranes, dehydration signs, and hypokalemia. Nasogastric tube aspiration shows significantly decreased gastric acid production. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is a VIPoma. VIPoma is a rare type of neuroendocrine tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to a syndrome characterized by watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (WDHA syndrome or Verner-Morrison syndrome). The combination of prolonged watery diarrhea, flushing, low potassium levels, and decreased gastric acid production aligns well with this diagnosis. While his recent travel history to Nigeria does warrant consideration of infectious causes, those typically don't account for the constellation of symptoms like flushing and significantly decreased gastric acid production. Therefore, VIPoma remains the most coherent explanation given the symptoms presented."}

{"question": "Explain how digitalis causes a positive inotropic effect in cardiac muscle cells through its action on the Na+/K+ ATPase pump.", "gold_answer": "Digitalis exerts its positive inotropic effect on cardiac muscle cells predominantly by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. These pumps are crucial in maintaining the balance of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane. Normally, they actively transport sodium out of and potassium into the cell. When digitalis inhibits these pumps, it disrupts this balance, leading to an increase in intracellular sodium levels.\n\nThis increase in sodium inside the cell affects the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger's function, which relies on the sodium gradient to extrude calcium out of the cell while bringing more sodium in. With the altered sodium balance, the exchanger becomes less efficient at removing calcium. Consequently, calcium ions begin to accumulate inside the cardiac cells.\n\nSince calcium ions are vital for muscle contraction, their accumulation results in stronger contractions of the heart muscle, enhancing the heart's ability to pump blood. This series of events—the inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pumps by digitalis, resulting in increased intracellular calcium—culminates in a positive inotropic effect, meaning the heart contracts more forcefully."}

{"question": "What are two key characteristics of laryngomalacia?", "gold_answer": "Two key characteristics of laryngomalacia are the presence of inspiratory stridor, which is a high-pitched sound heard during inhalation, often changing with the baby's position, and the omega-shaped epiglottis, indicating a structural abnormality where the soft tissues of the larynx are less rigid, leading to airway obstruction. These features are most commonly observed in infants shortly after birth as laryngomalacia is a congenital condition."}
{"question": "Identify two false statements about fetal development regarding the order of development of limbs and weight gain during trimesters.", "gold_answer": "Based on what we know about fetal development:\n\n1. It would be false to claim that the lower limbs develop before the upper limbs. The pattern of development generally follows the cephalocaudal principle, meaning structures closer to the head, like the upper limbs, develop before those further down, like the lower limbs.\n\n2. It would also be incorrect to say that significant weight gain occurs during the first trimester. Most of the significant fetal weight gain actually happens in the third trimester, as the fetus accumulates fat and prepares for birth. The first trimester is primarily focused on the development of basic structures and organ systems. \n\nThese interpretations align with established embryological principles and patterns observed during prenatal development."}
{"question": "A patient on amphotericin B develops a hypokalemia with a potassium level of 2.3 mEq/L. What is the required potassium supplementation over 24 hours to address this condition?", "gold_answer": "In the case of a patient on amphotericin B who has developed hypokalemia with a potassium level of 2.3 mEq/L, it is crucial to address the low potassium levels carefully and effectively. Calculating the potassium deficit, you find it to be approximately 170 mEq. However, it is important not to replace the entire deficit too rapidly to avoid complications such as hyperkalemia or cardiac issues.\n\nGiven the situation, a prudent approach would be to provide potassium supplementation in the range of 80 to 120 mEq over 24 hours. This amount allows for safe and gradual correction of the potassium deficit, aligning with standard clinical guidelines for hypokalemia management. Continuous monitoring of the patient's serum potassium levels is essential to adjust the supplementation as needed and ensure safe, effective treatment."}
{"question": "What is the result of endothelial cell cytoskeleton retraction during acute inflammation?", "gold_answer": "The retraction of the endothelial cell cytoskeleton during acute inflammation results in increased permeability of the blood vessels. This occurs because the retraction creates wider gaps between the endothelial cells, allowing more fluid, proteins, and immune cells to pass from the bloodstream into the surrounding tissue. This increased permeability is a critical part of the inflammatory response, aiding the immune system in reaching and addressing the underlying cause of inflammation, and contributing to the swelling commonly associated with inflammatory reactions."}
{"question": "What is the most likely cause of the symptoms in a 12-year-old boy presenting with abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and right lower quadrant tenderness, given the history of constipation and the provided vital signs?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms presented, namely abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and right lower quadrant tenderness in a 12-year-old boy, the most likely cause is acute appendicitis. The right lower quadrant tenderness, combined with fever and vomiting, is characteristic of appendicitis and aligns with the common presentation in children of this age. While the history of constipation could potentially play a role, such as contributing to an obstruction with a fecalith (a hard mass of stool), it is less likely to independently result in the fever and localized right lower quadrant pain observed here. Therefore, acute appendicitis is the primary condition to consider given these clinical signs."}
{"question": "What is the most important reason for conducting routine HIV tests for early identification of HIV infection in pregnant women?", "gold_answer": "The most important reason for conducting routine HIV tests for early identification of HIV infection in pregnant women is to prevent the transmission of the virus from mother to child. Early detection allows healthcare providers to initiate antiretroviral treatment, which significantly reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV—from as high as 15% to 45% without intervention—to less than 2%. This early intervention is crucial for protecting the health of the newborn while also supporting the health and well-being of the mother. Additionally, it contributes to broader public health efforts by reducing the overall spread of HIV within the community."}
{"question": "For an 11-month-old child who has received two doses of DPT and polio and returns for further immunization 5 months after the last dose, what is the appropriate next step in their immunization schedule?", "gold_answer": "For an 11-month-old child who has received two doses of both DPT (Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus) and polio vaccines, and whose last dose was given 5 months ago, the appropriate next step is to administer the third dose of both DPT and polio vaccines as soon as possible. This will complete their primary series for these vaccines and ensure the child has foundational immunity against these diseases.\n\nAdditionally, since the child is nearing 12 months of age, it's important to plan for the MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine, which is typically given at 12 months.

{"question": "For a 32-year-old patient with hepatitis C, a history of heroin addiction, and current treatment with naltrexone, who requires an urgent laparotomy for a perforated duodenal ulcer, and has pre-operative coagulation studies showing an INR of 1.8 and a platelet count of 85,000/cubic mm, what is the most appropriate post-operative analgesic technique?", "gold_answer": "For this patient, managing post-operative pain requires careful consideration due to the complexity of his medical situation. Given his history of heroin addiction, current use of naltrexone, and coagulopathy (INR of 1.8 and platelet count of 85,000), selecting analgesic options that minimize risks is crucial.\n\nOpioids would typically be ineffective due to naltrexone's opioid-blocking properties, and NSAIDs are less favorable given the patient's risk of bleeding, as they can exacerbate bleeding tendencies.\n\nConsidering these factors, a combination of acetaminophen and ketamine represents a suitable approach. Acetaminophen can help manage mild to moderate pain without increasing bleeding risk. Ketamine offers effective analgesia via NMDA receptor antagonism and is independent of the opioid receptor pathway, thus bypassing the blocking effects of naltrexone. Additionally, it does not increase bleeding risk, making it a safer choice given the patient's coagulation status.\n\nThus, the most appropriate post-operative analgesic technique for this patient would be the use of acetaminophen combined with careful administration of ketamine, ensuring effective pain control while minimizing potential risks associated with his underlying conditions and current treatment regimen."}
{"question": "A 70-year-old man with a history of ischemic stroke, type-II diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, presents with left-sided weakness. An MRI shows a new acute infarct involving the right middle cerebral artery, and ultrasound shows no carotid artery narrowing. He is currently taking low-dose aspirin but has no other antiplatelet therapy. Considering his history and current medications, what is the recommended next step in management to reduce his risk of future strokes?", "gold_answer": "To best manage this patient's risk of future strokes considering his new ischemic event and the lack of carotid artery narrowing, it's recommended to initiate dual antiplatelet therapy. This involves adding clopidogrel to his current regimen of low-dose aspirin. You would typically continue this dual therapy for a short duration, around 21 to 30 days, to decrease the acute risk of recurrent stroke without excessively increasing the risk of bleeding. Following this initial period, transitioning to clopidogrel monotherapy is advised. This approach balances the need for effective stroke prevention with the minimization of bleeding risks and aligns with current guidelines for secondary stroke prevention. Additionally, ensuring optimal management of his diabetes and hypertension is crucial, as these conditions contribute significantly to the risk of future strokes."}
{"question": "A 3-year-old child presents with severe headache, vomiting, bilateral papilledema, and impaired consciousness. An emergency contrast CT scan shows a multilocular mass in the cerebellum with well-defined white high-attenuation rings around black low-attenuation centers. Which predisposing condition is this cerebellar lesion most likely related to?", "gold_answer": "This 3-year-old child's symptoms and the CT scan findings you described could align with a cerebellar abscess. The appearance of ring-enhancing lesions, as noted with the high-attenuation rings and low-attenuation centers, often corresponds to abscesses. In this age group, brain abscesses can occur due to the spread of infections near the head or face, such as recurrent or severe middle ear infections (otitis media), which can spread to the cerebellum.\n\nWhile congenital heart diseases with right-to-left shunts are also predisposing conditions for brain abscesses due to potential for unfiltered pathogens to reach the brain, if the child has no known heart conditions or symptoms, the likelihood of an ear infection spreading and causing an abscess is quite plausible.\n\nTherefore, the predisposing condition most likely related to this cerebellar lesion is a history of middle ear infections."}
{"question": "An 11-year-old girl is diagnosed with scoliosis after presenting with a higher right scapula and a prominent spinal curvature detected during a school screening. If her scoliosis condition remains untreated, what type of lung disease is she most likely at risk of developing?", "gold_answer": "If an 11-year-old girl's scoliosis remains untreated, she is most likely at risk of developing restrictive lung disease. This is because untreated scoliosis can lead to a structural abnormality where the curvature of the spine affects the alignment and shape of the rib cage, thereby limiting lung expansion. Restrictive lung disease is characterized by this reduced lung expansion, which makes it difficult for the lungs to fully inflate, leading to decreased lung capacity."}
{"question": "A 55-year-old woman with a 1-year history of left-sided tinnitus is diagnosed with a tumor of the left jugular fossa, which results in decreased saliva production from the left parotid gland. Which other function is affected by the lesion of the same nerve responsible for this condition in the jugular fossa?", "gold_answer": "The glossopharyngeal nerve, or cranial nerve IX, is the nerve in question affected by the tumor in the left jugular fossa. This nerve is responsible for a variety of functions, which can be impacted by the lesion. In addition to controlling saliva production from the parotid gland, it also provides taste sensation to the posterior third of the tongue. Therefore, a function likely affected by the lesion of the glossopharyngeal nerve, besides saliva production, would be the taste sensation at the back of the tongue."}
{"question": "A 31-year-old female presents with fever, difficulty breathing, tea-colored urine in the morning, and laboratory findings of anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Lung examination reveals rales and chest radiograph shows consolidation. What specific immunological process is likely impaired leading to this clinical presentation?", "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation described is highly suggestive of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH), which is associated with a specific immunological impairment involving the complement system. In PNH, there is a deficiency of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which is necessary for the attachment of various protective proteins to the cell surface. Specifically, the lack of GPI-anchored proteins such as CD55 and CD59 on red blood cells makes them susceptible to uncontrolled complement activation and subsequent destruction, leading to intravascular hemolysis. This process explains the symptoms of hemolytic anemia, manifested as tea-colored urine due to hemoglobinuria, and can also contribute to the observed cytopenias (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia). Therefore, the impaired immunological process is the failure to regulate complement activity on the surface of blood cells due to the absence of necessary GPI-anchored protective proteins."}
{"question": "A two-month-old infant presents with marked respiratory distress, cyanosis, and bilateral crepitations. The heart rate is 180/min, respiratory rate 56/min, and liver span is 7.5 cm. The infant has a history of repeated episodes of fever, cough, and respiratory distress since birth. Cardiovascular examination shows a grade III ejection systolic murmur in the left para-sternal area, and a chest X-ray reveals cardiomegaly with a narrow base and plethoric lung fields. Based on these clinical findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation of the two-month-old infant—marked respiratory distress, cyanosis, the presence of a grade III ejection systolic murmur, and the X-ray findings of cardiomegaly with a narrow base and plethoric lung fields—points towards a congenital heart condition with significant hemodynamic consequences. Among the possible diagnoses, Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) best explains the symptoms and findings.\n\nTGA is a condition where the positions of the pulmonary artery and the aorta are switched, leading to parallel rather than series circulations, typically presenting with early cyanosis after birth. The characteristic \"egg on a string\" appearance noted in X-ray due to the narrow mediastinum aligns with the chest X-ray findings described. The infant's cyanosis, severe respiratory distress, and repeated respiratory issues since birth further support this diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, based on the details provided, the most likely diagnosis for this infant is Transposition of the Great Arteries."}

{"question": "A 29-year-old man with acute pancreatitis and hypotension is undergoing fluid resuscitation with normal saline. What is the most likely immediate physiological effect on the heart due to this intervention?", "gold_answer": "The most likely immediate physiological effect on the heart due to fluid resuscitation with normal saline in this patient would be an increase in preload. This occurs because the administration of normal saline increases the blood volume, which in turn increases the volume of blood returning to the heart, particularly into the right atrium. This higher venous return leads to greater end-diastolic volume and stretches the heart muscle fibers more, according to the Frank-Starling mechanism. Consequently, this results in the heart contracting more forcefully, which can increase stroke volume and cardiac output, assuming no significant change in heart rate. However, the immediate physiological effect that occurs first is the increase in preload."}
{"question": "A male patient presents with symptoms including headache, profuse sweating, palpitations, and a blood pressure reading of 160/110. Considering these symptoms, which drug is most effective for management and specifically blocks alpha receptors in the treatment of pheochromocytoma?", "gold_answer": "For a patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of pheochromocytoma, such as headache, sweating, palpitations, and high blood pressure, the drug phenoxybenzamine is most effective for management. Phenoxybenzamine is a non-selective alpha-adrenergic blocker that binds irreversibly to receptors, helping to control the symptoms by managing hypertension and avoiding excessive adrenergic stimulation. This drug is particularly helpful in preparing patients for any subsequent surgical intervention to remove the pheochromocytoma by stabilizing their blood pressure and other symptoms."}

{"question": "In the context of hepatic encephalopathy, what is the relationship between liver disease severity and ammonia levels, what effect does lactulose have on the colon, what is the nature of lactulose, how effective is rifaximin at 550 mg twice daily, and what prognostic sign does hepatic encephalopathy indicate?", "gold_answer": "In the context of hepatic encephalopathy, the severity of liver disease is closely linked to elevated ammonia levels in the blood. In healthy individuals, the liver effectively detoxifies ammonia, a byproduct of protein metabolism. However, when liver function is compromised, as in severe liver disease, ammonia accumulates, eventually reaching the brain and leading to symptoms such as confusion or coma, known collectively as hepatic encephalopathy.\n\nLactulose, a synthetic sugar, plays a crucial role in managing these high ammonia levels. It is not digested until it reaches the colon, where it's broken down by bacteria into acids, thereby lowering the pH. This causes ammonia to convert into ammonium, a less absorbable form, effectively trapping the ammonia in the gut for excretion. Lactulose also acts as a laxative, promoting bowel movements and further aiding in the removal of ammonium.\n\nRifaximin, at a dose of 550 mg taken twice daily, is highly effective as an antibiotic in reducing the intestinal bacteria responsible for ammonia production. This reduction in bacteria helps decrease the frequency of hepatic encephalopathy episodes, supporting overall management of the condition.\n\nPrognostically, the presence of hepatic encephalopathy is a significant indicator of advanced liver disease, reflecting severe liver damage. It often suggests the need for urgent medical intervention and can be an indication that consideration of liver transplant may be necessary. Hepatic encephalopathy serves as a serious warning about the critical state of liver health."}
{"question": "When should steroid therapy be initiated in a pregnant female with a history of having a child with congenital adrenal hyperplasia?", "gold_answer": "Steroid therapy, such as with dexamethasone, should be initiated in a pregnant woman with a history of having a child with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and ideally before the 9th week of gestation. This early initiation is crucial to help reduce the risk of virilization in a female fetus by suppressing excess adrenal androgen production. Starting treatment promptly ensures the best chance of preventing potential developmental issues associated with CAH."}
{"question": "What is the likely diagnosis for a 35-year-old person who has a strong, unfounded belief that their spouse is unfaithful, does not allow the spouse to leave home alone, persistently suspects their character, and takes actions like locking the house when going to work?", "gold_answer": "The likely diagnosis for this 35-year-old person is delusional disorder, jealous type. This condition is characterized by a firm, unjustified belief that a partner is unfaithful, despite a lack of evidence to support such suspicions. The individual's controlling behavior, such as not allowing their spouse to leave the house alone and taking actions like locking the house when they're at work, strongly indicates that the delusion has significantly impacted their behavior and perception of the relationship. This type of delusional disorder centers on specific themes of infidelity, differentiating it from other mental health disorders that might involve a broader range of delusions or additional symptoms."}
{"question": "If the content of adenine (A) in a DNA molecule is 15%, what is the percentage of guanine (G) in the DNA, according to Chargaff's base pair rule?", "gold_answer": "According to Chargaff's base pair rule, in any DNA molecule, the amount of adenine (A) equals the amount of thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G) equals the amount of cytosine (C). Given that the adenine content is 15%, the thymine content must also be 15%.\n\nTogether, adenine and thymine constitute 30% of the DNA. The remaining 70% is therefore composed of guanine and cytosine, which are equal in amount. Dividing the remaining percentage equally between guanine and cytosine gives us 35% each.\n\nThus, the percentage of guanine in the DNA is 35%."}

{"question": "A 17-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department after being stabbed with a knife during an altercation. Physical examination reveals a 4-cm stab wound on the right lateral border of the T1 spinous process. An MRI of the spinal cord shows damage to the area of the right lateral corticospinal tract at the level of T1. Based on this information, what neurological deficit is most likely to be observed as a result of the injury?", "gold_answer": "Based on the injury to the right lateral corticospinal tract at the T1 level, the most likely neurological deficit you would observe is weakness or paralysis on the right side, affecting the muscles below the level of the injury. This is due to the fact that the corticospinal tract is responsible for voluntary motor control and the fibers in the spinal cord control the same side of the body. The specific symptoms would include upper motor neuron signs such as increased muscle tone (spasticity) and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in the affected area of the upper body, primarily in the right arm and parts of the chest."}
{"question": "An elderly patient presents with a prolonged history of weakness and lethargy; he is found to be anemic and has a stool test positive for occult blood. Which investigation should be performed to identify the cause of these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of weakness, lethargy, anemia, and a stool test positive for occult blood, these signs point towards chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. In an elderly patient, such symptoms raise concerns about potential gastrointestinal tract issues, including possible malignancies such as colon cancer, or other conditions like bleeding diverticula or peptic ulcers.\n\nTo accurately identify the source of the gastrointestinal bleeding and the cause of the anemia, a colonoscopy is the most appropriate investigation to perform. A colonoscopy is a diagnostic procedure that allows direct visualization of the interior of the colon and rectum, enabling the identification of abnormalities like polyps, tumors, or sources of bleeding. Starting with a colonoscopy is crucial, especially given the positive stool occult blood test, which suggests a lower gastrointestinal tract source.\n\nTherefore, arranging a colonoscopy for this patient is the recommended course of action to investigate and identify the underlying cause of these symptoms."}
{"question": "Describe the process of healing by secondary intention in a patient with a large, asymptomatic ulcer as a result of uncontrolled diabetes, highlighting any differences in scar formation and wound contraction compared to primary intention healing.", "gold_answer": "Healing by secondary intention refers to the natural process the body undergoes to close a wound when it cannot be stitched together, typically due to size or tissue loss. In the context of a patient with diabetes and a large ulcer, this process is notably more complex and prolonged.\n\nThe healing journey starts with hemostasis, where the body works to stop bleeding through blood clot formation. Next, the inflammation phase sets in as the body's immune system attempts to cleanse the wound by removing dead tissues and preventing infection. However, for someone with uncontrolled diabetes, this phase can extend longer than usual. This happens because diabetes often impairs immune function, making it difficult to clear infections and debris efficiently.\n\nFollowing inflammation, the wound enters the proliferation phase. Here, new tissue, known as granulation tissue, begins to form. In diabetic patients, the proliferation phase can be significantly delayed due to poor blood circulation, which is crucial for forming new blood vessels integral to tissue growth.\n\nWound contraction is an essential step where the edges of the wound are drawn together by myofibroblasts. Diabetes can impair the function of these cells, slowing down this contraction process and sometimes leading to incomplete closure of the wound edges.\n\nAs secondary intention healing progresses, the result is often a larger and more prominent scar compared to primary intention healing, where surgical interventions, like stitches, align wound edges effectively for quicker and more aesthetically pleasing healing. In diabetic patients, hypertrophic scarring can be a concern, since diabetes can disrupt normal collagen production and deposition, leading to thick, non-pliable scars.\n\nIn summary, a large ulcer in a diabetic patient healing by secondary intention involves a significantly lengthened healing process compared to primary intention healing, culminating in more pronounced scarring due to extended inflammation, impaired tissue proliferation, and suboptimal wound contraction. This scenario presents a challenging framework for the body, compounded by the metabolic complications of diabetes."}

Insertion of Seldinger intercostal chest drain to cause resolution of pneumothorax\n\nThis choice balances the need for effective treatment of the 3 cm pneumothorax while minimizing the invasiveness of the procedure. Given the patient’s emphysema and the associated risk of air leakage due to bullae, a Seldinger technique provides a pragmatic solution that addresses the pneumothorax without the heightened risks associated with larger bore chest drains. Additionally, it is a more definitive approach compared to repeated aspirations or conservative management with high-flow oxygen alone."}
{"question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications.

{"question": "A 12-year-old child presents with a tingling sensation and numbness in the little finger and has a history of a fracture in the elbow region 4 years ago. Based on these symptoms, what specific type of fracture is most likely responsible for the current condition?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms of tingling and numbness in the little finger suggest an issue with the ulnar nerve, which is responsible for sensation in that area of the hand. The ulnar nerve runs close to the medial epicondyle of the humerus in the elbow region. Therefore, the most likely type of fracture that could lead to these symptoms is a fracture of the medial epicondyle. This type of fracture can result in ulnar nerve irritation or compression, explaining the child's current symptoms following an elbow fracture 4 years ago."}
{"question": "A 30-year-old woman gained weight, experiences constipation, and has sensitivity to cold and thinning hair after starting a medication. Laboratory results show low TSH and normal total and free T4 levels. What is the main mechanism of action of the medication that could have caused these symptoms and lab findings?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and laboratory findings you describe suggest a scenario where the medication's mechanism of action is primarily involved in suppressing TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) secretion without significantly altering T4 levels. This aligns with the action of dopamine agonists, which can inhibit TSH release from the pituitary gland. These medications, such as cabergoline or bromocriptine, work by activating dopamine receptors, leading to decreased secretion of TSH. This can result in the observed low TSH level in the lab results.\n\nWhile typically dopamine agonists do not cause classical hypothyroid symptoms because they do not necessarily reduce tissue thyroid hormone levels, in this case, it's possible the patient is experiencing an unusual array of side effects that mimic underactive thyroid function, such as weight gain, constipation, cold sensitivity, and thinning hair, although this is not the typical presentation.\n\nTherefore, the main mechanism of action for the medication causing these symptoms and lab findings is the suppression of TSH through dopamine receptor activation."}
{"question": "What is the most likely type of ovarian tumor in a 26-year-old woman presenting with sudden onset of left-sided lower abdominal pain, radiation to the back, pelvis, and thigh, a negative pregnancy test, enlarged left ovary with multiple calcifications on radiography, and adnexal torsion confirmed by laparoscopy, leading to ovariectomy?", "gold_answer": "The most likely type of ovarian tumor in this scenario is a mature cystic teratoma, also known as a dermoid cyst. Given the patient's age, the presence of calcifications on the radiography, and the fact that adnexal torsion has occurred, this type of tumor is the most probable diagnosis. Mature cystic teratomas frequently contain various tissue types, including those that can calcify, and they are the most common benign ovarian tumors in women of reproductive age. The weight and composition of such a tumor can predispose the ovary to torsion, leading to the acute symptoms described."}

{"question": "A 40-year-old male patient is experiencing slowly progressive dysphagia to both solids and liquids, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss over 2 months. Barium swallow, esophageal manometry, and upper GI endoscopy have been performed. Which organism is most commonly implicated in causing this condition?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and test results you've described — progressive dysphagia for both solids and liquids, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss, coupled with findings suggestive of esophageal motility disorder through barium swallow, esophageal manometry, and upper GI endoscopy — are classic for achalasia. Achalasia is primarily idiopathic, but in certain regions, it can be secondary to an infectious disease. The protozoan organism most commonly implicated in causing achalasia-like symptoms through an infectious route is Trypanosoma cruzi, the pathogen responsible for Chagas disease. In areas endemic to this parasite, chronic infection can lead to damage of the esophageal nerves, mimicking achalasia. Thus, in the context of an infectious cause, the organism you are looking for is indeed Trypanosoma cruzi."}

This disruption leads to reduced secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which in turn causes a drop in serum calcium levels.\n\nThe tingling in her hands and feet, severe muscle cramps, laryngeal stridor, and convulsions are classic signs of hypocalcemia, or low calcium levels. Given the mechanism behind her symptoms, we would expect her laboratory findings to show:\n\n- **Decreased serum calcium**: Due to the lower levels of PTH, which is necessary for calcium reabsorption and regulation in the body.\n- **Decreased PTH**: Resulting from potential damage or removal of the parathyroid glands during surgery.\n\nTherefore, the expected laboratory findings in this patient prior to treatment are decreased serum calcium and decreased PTH, which corresponds to option A."}
{"question": "A patient exhibits swelling of the ankles and a bloated abdomen with a history of malnutrition. What physiological change is most likely the cause of the bloated abdomen in this scenario?", "gold_answer": "The bloated abdomen exhibited by the patient is most likely caused by a decrease in plasma oncotic pressure due to low levels of albumin, a protein. In malnutrition, particularly protein deficiency, the synthesis of albumin is compromised, which in turn reduces the oncotic pressure within blood vessels. This decrease in oncotic pressure allows fluid to leak from the vascular space into the interstitial and third spaces, like the abdominal cavity, leading to ascites, or fluid accumulation in the abdomen. Therefore, the physiological change responsible for the bloated abdomen in this scenario is the reduced oncotic pressure resulting from hypoalbuminemia."}
{"question": "What is the appropriate treatment for a 40-year-old female with a pleomorphic adenoma in the parotid region, where the biopsy shows that the condition has caused the tonsil to be pushed medially?", "gold_answer": "The appropriate treatment for a 40-year-old female with a pleomorphic adenoma in the parotid region, especially given that it has grown large enough to cause the tonsil to be pushed medially, is surgical excision. In this case, considering the size and impact of the tumor, a total parotidectomy may be necessary to ensure complete removal. During this procedure, utmost care would be taken to preserve the facial nerve to prevent any postoperative nerve damage. Surgical excision is crucial both to prevent recurrence and to reduce the risk of the benign tumor potentially transforming into a malignant form."}
{"question": "An 80-year-old woman presents with general malaise, low-grade fever, retinal hemorrhages with pale centers, erythematous nodules on the palms, splinter hemorrhages, and vegetations on the mitral valve. Blood culture reveals gram-positive bacteria that are catalase negative and can grow in 40% bile but not in 6.5% NaCl. Apart from endocarditis, which associated medical condition should be considered in this patient based on these findings?", "gold_answer": "In this patient, presenting with symptoms indicative of infective endocarditis and having blood cultures that indicate Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly known as Streptococcus bovis), it is crucial to consider the possibility of associated colorectal cancer. Streptococcus gallolyticus bacteremia or endocarditis is well known to be linked with underlying gastrointestinal malignancies, particularly colorectal cancer. Therefore, investigating for colorectal cancer should be an important part of the patient's diagnostic work-up alongside the treatment for endocarditis."}
{"question": "A 57-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II presents for a routine check-up. His blood glucose levels have been inconsistently controlled with medications and diet since his diagnosis 3 years ago. At this current visit, urinalysis demonstrates albumin levels of 250 mg/day. All prior urinalyses have shown albumin levels below 20 mg/day. At this point in the progression of the patient’s disease, which of the following is the most likely finding seen on kidney biopsy?\nA. Normal kidney biopsy, no pathological finding is evident at this time\nB. Glomerular hypertrophy with slight glomerular basement membrane thickening\nC. Glomerular basement membrane thickening and mesangial expansion\nD. Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules and tubulointerstitial fibrosis\nE. Significant global glomerulosclerosis", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided, the 57-year-old male with type 2 diabetes is showing signs of kidney involvement, indicated by an increase in albuminuria to 250 mg/day. This level of albuminuria is classified as microalbuminuria, which is consistent with the early stages of diabetic nephropathy.\n\nDuring the early stages of diabetic nephropathy, especially at the microalbuminuria level, the typical findings on a kidney biopsy would include glomerular basement membrane thickening and mesangial expansion due to the damaging effects of the persistent hyperglycemia associated with diabetes. These changes reflect the structural alterations in the glomeruli at this stage of kidney disease.\n\nOther options, such as Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules and significant global glomerulosclerosis, generally appear at more advanced stages of diabetic nephropathy when there is more pronounced proteinuria (macroalbuminuria) or end-stage kidney disease. Conversely, glomerular hypertrophy with minimal changes is more typical of even earlier stages, potentially before microalbuminuria becomes evident. A normal biopsy would not be consistent with the current level of albuminuria.\n\nTherefore, given the context and progression of his disease, the most likely finding on a kidney biopsy at this stage is:\n\nC. Glomerular basement membrane thickening and mesangial expansion."}
{"question": "A patient presents with dyspnea and bilateral diffuse wheezing upon lung auscultation. Which medication would provide the fastest symptomatic relief?", "gold_answer": "For a patient presenting with dyspnea and bilateral diffuse wheezing, albuterol would provide the fastest symptomatic relief. Albuterol is a short-acting beta-agonist that works quickly to relax and open the airways, making it an ideal choice for acute relief in situations like asthma attacks or sudden bronchospasm."}
{"question": "If a patient presents with a loss of sensation at the angle of the mandible and the parotid area, which specific nerve is most likely to be injured?", "gold_answer": "The nerve most likely to be injured, leading to a loss of sensation at the angle of the mandible and the parotid area, is the great auricular nerve. This nerve arises from the cervical plexus, specifically from the C2 and C3 spinal nerves, and provides sensory innervation to these regions. Injury to this nerve can result in the numbness you're describing, often due to surgical procedures or trauma near the jaw, neck, or parotid gland."}
{"question": "A previously healthy 18-year-old woman develops swelling and itchiness of her mouth and lips two days after orthodontic wire placement, with relief from cold foods. She has diffuse erythema and edema of the buccal mucosa with serous vesicles and shallow ulcers, but no skin blistering from pressure. Considering her recent exposure, what is the most likely cause of these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms this 18-year-old woman is experiencing are most likely due to a contact allergy, specifically to nickel in the orthodontic wire. Nickel is a common allergen and is frequently found in metal dental appliances including wires used in braces. The timing of her symptoms—swelling, itchiness, erythema, vesicles, and ulcers around the mouth—starting just after the placement of the orthodontic wire, along with the fact that she finds relief with cold foods, strongly suggests a contact allergic reaction to the nickel in the wire. This type of allergic reaction can manifest soon after exposure and lines up well with the onset and presentation of her oral symptoms."}
{"question": "A 5-year-old girl presents with hypertension, virilization, and hypokalemia. Based on these clinical findings, what is the diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical findings of hypertension, virilization, and hypokalemia in the 5-year-old girl, the diagnosis is likely 11-beta hydroxylase deficiency. This condition is a type of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) characterized by excessive production of 11-deoxycorticosterone, which has mineralocorticoid activity, leading to hypertension and hypokalemia. Additionally, it causes an overproduction of adrenal androgens, which explains the virilization observed in the patient."}
{"question": "A 36 years old woman recently treated for leukemia is admitted to the hospital with malaise, chills and high fever. Gram stain of blood reveals the presence of gram-negative bacilli. The initial diagnosis is bacteremia and parenteral antibiotics are indicated. The record of the patient reveals that she had a severe urticarial rash, hypotension and respiratory difficulty after oral penicillin V about 6 months ago. The most appropriate drug should be :\nA. Ampicillin plus Sulbactam\nB. Aztreonam\nC. Cefazolin\nD. Imipenem plus cilastatin", "gold_answer": "Given the patient's severe allergic reaction to penicillin, we must select an antibiotic that minimizes the risk of a cross-reaction. Aztreonam, a monobactam, is known for having minimal cross-reactivity with penicillins, making it the most appropriate choice in this situation to safely address the gram-negative bacteremia without risking another allergic reaction. Therefore, the most suitable antibiotic for this patient is:\n\nB. Aztreonam"}
{"question": "The placenta secretes a hormone that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy. This hormone is:\nA. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nB. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nC. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nD. Relaxin", "gold_answer": "The hormone secreted by the placenta that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy is B. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone is crucial because it is produced shortly after a fertilized egg attaches to the uterine lining, making it a key indicator for early pregnancy tests."}
{"question": "A child presents with a history of scorpion sting.He is having increased sweating. What is the next best step -\nA. Lytic cocktail\nB. Atropine\nC. Antevenom\nD. Local xylocaine infiltration", "gold_answer": "In the scenario described, the child who has been stung by a scorpion and is experiencing increased sweating likely indicates overactivity in the autonomic nervous system, particularly the cholinergic component. Given the potential for significant autonomic symptoms, a lytic cocktail would be the most comprehensive choice for treatment. It addresses both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system imbalances, thereby helping manage the sweating and any other emerging symptoms. Therefore, the next best step is A. Lytic cocktail."}
{"question": "What medication is absolutely contraindicated for a mother while she is breastfeeding her newborn baby?", "gold_answer": "Chemotherapy medications are absolutely contraindicated for a mother while she is breastfeeding her newborn baby. These drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and doxorubicin, are powerful agents used to treat cancer. They can be highly toxic and have the potential to cause significant harm to a baby's developing immune system and overall health if passed through breast milk. Therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with these medications to ensure the safety and well-being of the infant."}
{"question": "According to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, who is not involved in the certification of brainstem death?", "gold_answer": "According to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, individuals who are directly involved in the transplantation procedure, such as transplant surgeons, are not involved in the certification of brainstem death. This measure ensures that there is no conflict of interest and that the certification process remains unbiased and ethically sound. The certification typically involves senior clinicians, neurologists, neurosurgeons, intensivists, or anesthetists, and an independent registered medical practitioner, but excludes those directly performing the transplant surgeries."}
{"question": "A 40-year-old patient is undergoing surgery for a direct hernia, and during the procedure, two hernial sacs are observed. What is the diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The presence of two hernial sacs during surgery for what was initially thought to be a direct hernia suggests the diagnosis of a \"pantaloon hernia.\" This type of hernia involves both a direct and an indirect hernia on the same side, often appearing like a pair of pants as they straddle the inferior epigastric vessels. This explains the observation of two hernial sacs in the surgical area."}
{"question": "What is the most likely cause of the 'bead-like' appearance of the fallopian tube and clubbing of the ampulla in a 30-year-old woman examined for infertility by hysterosalpingography?", "gold_answer": "The most likely cause of the 'bead-like' appearance of the fallopian tube and clubbing of the ampulla observed on hysterosalpingography in a 30-year-old woman struggling with infertility is genital tuberculosis. This condition can lead to chronic granulomatous inflammation, resulting in characteristic nodular and scarring patterns in the fallopian tubes, which can match the described findings. While pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a more common cause of infertility due to its role in scarring and structural changes to the tubes, the specific description of a bead-like appearance aligns more closely with the changes seen in tuberculosis. Therefore, in this context, genital tuberculosis is the more likely diagnosis."}
{"question": "In a patient with acute leukemia, what type of leukemia is suggested by the immunophenotype pattern CD 19 positive, CD 10 positive, CD33 positive, and CD13 positive?", "gold_answer": "The immunophenotype pattern showing positivity for both B-cell markers (CD19 and CD10) and myeloid markers (CD33 and CD13) suggests a diagnosis of mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), specifically a B-cell/myeloid subtype. MPAL is characterized by the expression of antigens that are typical of more than one lineage, which in this case shows both B-cell and myeloid features. This type of leukemia differs from others that fit neatly into B-cell or myeloid categories because it displays characteristics of both lineages."}
{"question": "In the context of a woman having had a previous cesarean section, what is not considered a standard indication for an elective cesarean section?", "gold_answer": "In the context of a woman who has had a previous cesarean section, polyhydramnios, which is an excess of amniotic fluid, is not typically considered a standard indication for an elective cesarean section. While there are valid medical reasons for planning a repeat cesarean, such as the risk of uterine rupture, issues with placenta previa, or complications from multiple prior cesareans, polyhydramnios on its own does not usually necessitate an elective cesarean unless it is associated with other significant complications. Other non-standard reasons that might be considered but are not medically necessary include scheduling convenience or maternal request without medical backing."}
{"question": "A 40-year-old chronic alcoholic is investigated for anemia and tests show increased serum iron and increased transferrin saturation. What diagnosis is most consistent with these findings?", "gold_answer": "Based on the information given, the most consistent diagnosis for a 40-year-old chronic alcoholic with increased serum iron and increased transferrin saturation is hereditary hemochromatosis. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet, leading to iron overload. This iron accumulates in various organs, particularly the liver, which is consistent with the chronic alcohol use and potential liver involvement seen in this patient. These lab findings align well with this condition, as both serum iron and transferrin saturation are typically elevated in hereditary hemochromatosis. This diagnosis would explain the observed laboratory results and fits with the overall clinical picture."}
{"question": "What are the radiological features typically seen in spondylolisthesis?", "gold_answer": "The radiological features typically seen in spondylolisthesis are:\n\n1. **Forward Slippage**: On lateral (side-view) X-rays, you'll notice one vertebra slipping forward over the one beneath it. The extent of this slippage can be quantified using the Meyerding classification system, which categorizes the degree of slippage based on the percentage of vertebra movement.\n\n2. **Pars Interarticularis Defects**: In cases such as isthmic spondylolisthesis, you might observe a defect or fracture in the pars interarticularis on X-rays. This often appears on specific angles (like an oblique view) revealing a \"scotty dog\" sign where the fracture is seen as a line or collar.\n\n3. **Degenerative Changes**: In older patients, degenerative spondylolisthesis may show accompanying features such as decreased disk space height, facet joint enlargement, and osteophyte formation, particularly around the area of vertebral slippage.\n\nThese radiological indicators collectively help confirm the diagnosis of spondylolisthesis and provide insights into its underlying cause and severity."}
{"question": "A patient presents with a chronic productive cough, clubbing, and coarse rales. Based on these clinical findings, what diagnosis is indicated by the CT scan?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical presentation of a chronic productive cough, clubbing, and coarse rales, the findings from the CT scan are most indicative of bronchiectasis. This condition is characterized by the dilation and thickening of the airways often accompanied by mucus plugs, which aligns with the symptoms provided."}
{"question": "When assessing burns in a five-year-old child, what percentage of the total body surface area does an area equivalent to the size of the child's palm represent?", "gold_answer": "When assessing burns in a five-year-old child, an area equivalent to the size of the child's palm, including the fingers, represents approximately 1% of the total body surface area. This estimation is consistent with the guidance used for both children and adults in medical settings."}
{"question": "Who originally prescribed the term 'periodontal plastic surgery' that replaced 'mucogingival surgery' as recognized by the 1996 World Workshop in Clinical Periodontics?", "gold_answer": "The term 'periodontal plastic surgery' emerged as a replacement for 'mucogingival surgery' during the 1996 World Workshop in Clinical Periodontics. However, attributing the term to a single individual is challenging, as these changes are typically the result of collaborative efforts within the periodontics community. The terminology shift reflects a broader consensus among experts and likely resulted from discussions and deliberations among multiple contributors at the workshop. It's a common occurrence in the medical field for terminology to evolve through shared insights and collective agreement rather than being attributed to one person."}
{"question": "A previously healthy 11-year-old girl develops cramping and watery stools due to a gastrointestinal infection, which progresses to passing blood per rectum. She is hospitalized for dehydration, and upon examination, she shows decreased urine output, rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN), anemia, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytes on a peripheral smear. Which bacterial genus is most likely responsible for this syndrome, characterized by these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The bacterial genus most likely responsible for this syndrome, characterized by bloody diarrhea progressing to Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), is Escherichia. Specifically, Escherichia coli, particularly the strain O157:H7, is known to produce Shiga toxin, leading to these symptoms. HUS often develops following infections with this strain, which fits the presentation given in the question."}
{"question": "A 28-year-old woman with bipolar disorder is found to have a lithium level of 2.3 mEq/L, which is above the normal range of 0.6-1.25 mEq/L. What side effect is she most likely to experience due to this elevated lithium level?", "gold_answer": "The 28-year-old woman is most likely to experience tremor as a side effect due to her elevated lithium level. With a lithium level of 2.3 mEq/L, which is significantly above the therapeutic range, she would be at risk for lithium toxicity. Common symptoms of lithium toxicity include gastrointestinal issues like nausea and diarrhea and neurological symptoms such as tremors, confusion, and ataxia. Among these, tremor is a well-recognized and frequent manifestation of lithium toxicity at high levels."}
{"question": "According to the DSM IV, for how long must the symptoms of mania persist in a young lady who is not hospitalised to fulfil the diagnostic criteria for Bipolar Disorder?", "gold_answer": "According to the DSM-IV, for a manic episode to be diagnosed in the context of Bipolar Disorder, the symptoms of mania must persist for at least one week in situations where the individual is not hospitalized. This duration is crucial for fulfilling the diagnostic criteria, unless the symptoms are severe enough to require hospitalization or result in significant impairment or psychotic features, in which case the duration criteria might not need to be met."}
{"question": "In a partial mRNA sequence, if a mutation in the template DNA leads to codon 91 of the mRNA altering to UAA, what type of mutation has occurred?", "gold_answer": "The alteration of codon 91 in the mRNA sequence to UAA represents a type of mutation known as a \"nonsense mutation.\" Nonsense mutations occur when a codon that originally encoded an amino acid is changed to a stop codon (like UAA, UAG, or UGA), prematurely terminating translation. This results in a truncated, and often nonfunctional, protein because the synthesis process halts before completing the full-length protein originally intended. Such mutations can have significant impacts on protein function and cellular processes."}
{"question": "A 42-year-old man with a history of trauma on the left side from a car accident exhibits fractures of the left tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, and the left tibia and fibula. He presents with hematuria and left flank pain, and imaging shows no excretion from the left kidney while the right kidney functions normally. Given this clinical scenario, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?", "gold_answer": "In this clinical scenario, the patient presents with signs that are highly suggestive of a potential vascular injury to the left kidney, especially considering the absence of excretion and the history of trauma. Given the concern for a renal artery injury, which could have serious implications for the kidney's viability, the most appropriate next step is to perform a CT angiogram. This imaging study will allow for a detailed examination of the renal vasculature to determine if there is an injury to the renal artery or another vascular structure affecting blood flow to the kidney. It is crucial to accurately diagnose the vascular status as soon as possible to decide on the appropriate intervention to preserve renal function."}
{"question": "In the evaluation of oliguria in a 15-month-old girl with a history of poor oral fluid intake, occasional vomiting, rapid breathing, decreased urine output, a pulse of 150/min, BP of 120/80, respiratory rate of 60/min, bibasilar rales, and a palpable liver, which procedure should be avoided because it may not be helpful?", "gold_answer": "In the clinical scenario described, administering a fluid challenge should be avoided. Given the symptoms that suggest possible heart failure—such as rapid breathing, high blood pressure for a child of this age, rales, and hepatic enlargement—introducing additional fluid could exacerbate the condition if the underlying issue is cardiac-related rather than simple dehydration. Instead, focusing on diagnostic measures, like echocardiography and chest X-rays, to better understand her heart function and fluid status would be more appropriate before considering treatment options that involve fluid administration."}
{"question": "When epidural anesthesia is initiated in a primigravida at 38 weeks gestation with a bolus of 15mg of Bupivacaine, and fetal heart rate monitoring shows variable decelerations accompanied by fetal acidosis as indicated by scalp pH, how is the concentration and form of the anesthetic absorbed by the fetus affected, compared to a normal pH?", "gold_answer": "When epidural anesthesia is administered during labor using Bupivacaine and the fetus experiences acidosis, the pharmacokinetics of the drug are indeed affected. Bupivacaine, a weak base, becomes more ionized in acidic conditions, such as those present in fetal acidosis. \n\nUnder normal pH conditions, Bupivacaine is less ionized, which facilitates its passage across cellular membranes, including the placenta. However, in the acidic environment caused by fetal acidosis, more of the Bupivacaine becomes ionized. Ionized Bupivacaine is less lipid-soluble, meaning it crosses the placenta with greater difficulty compared to its non-ionized form. Consequently, one might expect less Bupivacaine to cross into the fetal circulation initially.\n\nDespite this, the phenomenon of \"ion trapping\" can occur. Once Bupivacaine does cross into the fetal environment, it can become trapped. The increased acidity ionizes the drug, preventing it from moving back across the placenta easily. Therefore, although initial transfer may be reduced, the concentration of Bupivacaine that does reach the fetus could be higher due to this trapping effect. This ion trapping can result in a relative accumulation of Bupivacaine in the fetal circulation compared to when the fetal pH is normal.\n\nIn summary, while fetal acidosis reduces the initial transfer of Bupivacaine from mother to fetus due to increased ionization, any Bupivacaine that crosses the placenta can become trapped in the fetus, potentially leading to higher levels of ionized drug within the fetal circulation."}
{"question": "What condition should be excluded through histopathologic evaluation when a recurrent Chalazion is present?", "gold_answer": "When a recurrent chalazion is present, it's important to exclude sebaceous gland carcinoma through histopathologic evaluation. This type of carcinoma can mimic the appearance of a chalazion, and ensuring an accurate diagnosis is crucial to prevent potential complications."}
{"question": "A 50-year-old female presents with sudden blindness, scalp tenderness, and pain while combing her hair. A temporal artery biopsy reveals intimal thickening with granulomatous inflammation. What is the diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and biopsy findings you describe are highly characteristic of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), also known as Temporal Arteritis. This condition typically involves inflammation of the large and medium-sized arteries, particularly the temporal arteries, leading to symptoms like sudden vision loss and scalp tenderness, as you noted. The biopsy results showing intimal thickening and granulomatous inflammation with presence of giant cells further support this diagnosis. It is crucial to start treatment promptly to prevent further complications, especially pertaining to vision."}

Inseed into the 4th or 5th ICS along the scapular line\nD. Done in Upper pa of Lower Rib to avoid vessel and nerve injury", "gold_answer": "The false statement regarding the insertion of an Intercostal Drain (ICD) for a pneumothorax is:\n\nC. Inserted into the 4th or 5th ICS along the scapular line\n\nFor an ICD insertion, especially in the context of treating a pneumothorax, the typical insertion point is the mid-axillary line at the 4th or 5th intercostal space, not the scapular line. The scapular line is further back and not commonly used for ICD placement in this context, making option C the incorrect statement."}
{"question": "What is the diagnosis for a patient who experiences tooth pain when ingesting hot foods that subsides upon consuming cold substances?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms you're describing—pain in a tooth when consuming hot foods that subsides with cold substances—are atypical but could indicate a type of pulpitis, most likely irreversible pulpitis. Typically, in cases of pulpitis, heat can increase pain because it aggravates inflammation within the pulp. In the case of irreversible pulpitis, the nerve inside the tooth is inflamed, and the relief from cold might be due to a temporary calming effect on the inflamed area, although this is not a common reaction. \n\nWhile the response to thermal changes is not what you'd usual see with classic pulpitis, the fact that heat causes pain suggests pulp involvement. Such cases sometimes present with unusual or inconsistent symptoms depending on the condition's progression. It’s advisable to seek a dental evaluation for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment."}
{"question": "What is the reason for a patient developing restlessness and sweating after the administration of intravenous quinine?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms of restlessness and sweating following the administration of intravenous quinine in a patient are likely due to hypoglycemia. Quinine is known to cause a decrease in blood glucose levels, which can trigger the activation of the sympathetic nervous system resulting in symptoms such as sweating and restlessness. It's important to monitor the patient’s blood sugar and manage it appropriately to address and prevent these symptoms."}
{"question": "What factor in the patient's medical history and treatment increased her risk of developing diarrhea with anaerobic, gram-positive bacilli present in stool testing following an episode of antibiotic-treated pneumonia?", "gold_answer": "The factor in the patient's medical history and treatment that increased her risk of developing diarrhea with anaerobic, gram-positive bacilli, such as Clostridium difficile, present in stool testing following antibiotic-treated pneumonia is likely the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antibiotics like clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, or cephalosporins are particularly known for disrupting the normal gut flora, which can lead to overgrowth of C. difficile. Additionally, if the patient is taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as esomeprazole, this can further disrupt gut bacterial balance and increase the risk. The combination of these treatments creates an environment conducive for C. difficile proliferation, resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea."}

Therefore, the correct options are:\n\nD. ab"}
{"question": "A 35-year-old alcoholic presents with diarrhea and a scaly rash on his neck, hands, and feet. What deficiency is likely causing these symptoms and what vitamin should be used in treatment?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms you're describing—diarrhea and a scaly rash on sun-exposed areas like the neck, hands, and feet—are indicative of pellagra, which is caused by a deficiency of niacin (Vitamin B3). This condition is often linked to poor nutritional intake or absorption, which can be prevalent in individuals with alcohol use disorder due to factors like inadequate dietary intake and impaired absorption of nutrients. To treat this condition, niacin supplements should be administered to address the deficiency and alleviate the symptoms."}
{"question": "A diabetic patient developed cellulitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Which antibiotic would not be appropriate for treating this infection?", "gold_answer": "For treating a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, using methicillin or any other beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, would be inappropriate. MRSA is resistant to these antibiotics, rendering them ineffective against the infection. Therefore, an antibiotic like methicillin would not be suitable for treating this MRSA-caused cellulitis. Instead, other options like vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin are typically used to treat MRSA infections effectively."}
{"question": "A 70-year-old woman in the medical intensive care unit with sepsis of pulmonary origin is experiencing slow bleeding from intravenous line sites and around her urinary catheter on hospital day 2. Based on these clinical findings, what are the expected results of her coagulation studies?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical findings described, the expected results of the coagulation studies for this 70-year-old woman are consistent with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). In DIC, the coagulation system is paradoxically activated and exhausted, leading to both clotting and bleeding. Here are the expected results:\n\n1. **Prothrombin Time (PT)**: Prolonged due to consumption of clotting factors.\n2. **Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)**: Prolonged, also reflecting factor depletion.\n3. **Platelet Count**: Low, as platelets are consumed in widespread coagulation.\n4. **D-dimer**: Elevated, indicating increased fibrin degradation due to active clot breakdown.\n5. **Fibrinogen**: Typically low because fibrinogen is consumed as clots are formed.\n\nThese findings align with the characteristic pattern seen in DIC, which can occur as a complication of sepsis."}
{"question": "A young boy is evaluated for failure to thrive, and biochemical analysis of a duodenal aspirate after a meal reveals a deficiency of enteropeptidase. Which digestive enzyme's activation would be directly affected by this deficiency?", "gold_answer": "The enzyme directly affected by a deficiency in enteropeptidase is trypsinogen. Enteropeptidase's primary role is to activate trypsinogen, converting it into trypsin. This activation is critical because trypsin then activates other digestive enzymes necessary for protein digestion in the small intestine. So, without adequate enteropeptidase, the activation of trypsinogen is directly impaired."}
{"question": "In a 37-year-old female with a contracture of the third digit of her left hand and a firm, hard, cordlike, 1x3 cm area beneath the skin of the left palm, which has been developing over 6 months, what is the histological composition most likely found in this mass?", "gold_answer": "In the case of a 37-year-old female with a contracture of the third digit of her left hand and a firm, hard, cordlike mass beneath the skin of the left palm, the histological composition of this mass is most likely to consist of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. These cells are responsible for the production of collagen within the affected palmar fascia. Specifically, in Dupuytren's contracture, you would see an abundance of type III collagen initially, which progressively gets replaced by type I collagen as the disease progresses. This proliferation of fibrous tissue aligns with the characteristic changes seen in Dupuytren's contracture."}
{"question": "A patient experiencing a classic acute migraine attack developed nausea and vomiting after taking a certain medication. Additionally, the patient experienced tingling, numbness, and a blue discoloration of the fingertip, indicative of vasoconstriction. Which drug is most likely responsible for these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms you're describing—nausea, vomiting, tingling, numbness, and blue discoloration of the fingertips—are indicative of vasoconstriction, which can be a side effect of certain migraine medications. Based on these symptoms, the drug most likely responsible is ergotamine. Ergotamine is known for its potent vasoconstrictive properties, and these effects can sometimes lead to the type of reactions you're seeing. This situation exemplifies how ergotamine can cause significant vasoconstriction, leading to reduced blood flow and resulting in symptoms like tingling and discoloration in extremities."}
{"question": "A 29-year-old man presents to the clinic with greasy, foul-smelling diarrhea following a camping trip where he consumed untreated stream water. His stool sample reveals motile protozoa on microscopy, with no ova, blood cells, or pus cells detected. Based on these findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 29-year-old man is Giardiasis. This condition is caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia. The symptoms of greasy, foul-smelling diarrhea following the consumption of untreated stream water during a camping trip are classic for Giardia infection. The presence of motile protozoa in the stool sample, without any signs of inflammation such as blood or pus cells, further supports this diagnosis. Giardia typically causes malabsorption leading to steatorrhea, which aligns with the symptoms described."}
{"question": "Which joints are most commonly involved in osteoarthritis?", "gold_answer": "Osteoarthritis most commonly affects the knees, hips, and hands. In the hands, the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints, which are located near the tips of the fingers and just below them, are frequently involved. Additionally, the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb is commonly affected. These joints are particularly susceptible due to their constant use and, in the case of the knees and hips, their role as major load-bearing joints in the body."}
{"question": "In a newborn presenting with shock, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia, what condition is most likely responsible for these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms of shock, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia in a newborn are most likely caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), specifically due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This condition leads to inadequate production of aldosterone and cortisol, which results in the inability to regulate potassium and glucose levels properly, and can cause adrenal crisis if not treated promptly."}
{"question": "A 29-year-old woman develops a fever, cough, and shortness of breath six days after undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Serum studies show a sodium concentration of 129 mEq/L, and a chest x-ray reveals a left-sided pleural effusion. Thoracentesis yields milky white pleural fluid that remains uniform after centrifugation, with no organisms found on culture. What component is most likely elevated upon further analysis of this pleural fluid?", "gold_answer": "The component most likely elevated in the pleural fluid of this patient is triglycerides. The milky appearance of the pleural fluid, in conjunction with the context of recent thoracic surgery, suggests a chylothorax, where lymphatic fluid containing high levels of triglycerides leaks into the pleural space."}
{"question": "Which drug is not used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among the commonly prescribed antibiotics?", "gold_answer": "Among the commonly prescribed antibiotics, tobramycin is not used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). MDR-TB treatment typically involves specific antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones (like levofloxacin and moxifloxacin), aminoglycosides (such as amikacin), and newer drugs like bedaquiline and linezolid, none of which include tobramycin as part of standard therapy protocols for MDR-TB."}
{"question": "A 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and a prior myocardial infarction presents with decreased sexual function and is prescribed a medication also used to treat pulmonary hypertension. What is the specific downstream effect of this medication on cGMP?", "gold_answer": "The specific downstream effect of the medication prescribed, which is likely a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor such as sildenafil, is the increase of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels. By inhibiting the enzyme PDE5, the medication prevents the breakdown of cGMP, resulting in higher cGMP levels. This leads to enhanced relaxation of smooth muscle and vasodilation, consequently improving blood flow. This mechanism effectively addresses both erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension by improving circulation."}
{"question": "A 26-year-old pregnant woman at 25 weeks of gestation presents with a fetus showing ascites, liver enlargement, and pleural effusion, along with elevated peak systolic velocity of the fetal middle cerebral artery as detected by Doppler ultrasound. Considering these symptoms and her blood results, which procedure can be used both to diagnose the condition further and to provide therapeutic intervention?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms presented in the fetus, such as ascites, liver enlargement, pleural effusion, and the elevated peak systolic velocity of the fetal middle cerebral artery, strongly suggest a condition like hydrops fetalis possibly due to fetal anemia. In situations like this, where there is a high suspicion of anemia potentially caused by Rh incompatibility or other factors, a procedure called cordocentesis is appropriate. \n\nCordocentesis, also known as percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), can be used to directly sample fetal blood. This procedure allows for the measurement of hemoglobin levels and a direct assessment of the severity of anemia. Additionally, if severe anemia is confirmed, the procedure can be followed by an intrauterine blood transfusion to treat the condition. Thus, cordocentesis serves a dual purpose: aiding in the diagnosis and allowing for immediate therapeutic intervention, providing crucial care for the fetus under these complex circumstances."}
{"question": "A 38-year-old woman had a Pap smear showing a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion with a positive HPV test, and her colposcopic biopsy revealed CIN 1. Given her history and these findings, what is the appropriate next step in her management?", "gold_answer": "Given the scenario of a 38-year-old woman with a Pap smear indicating high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), a positive HPV test, and a colposcopy revealing CIN 1, the management approach should be weighed carefully. The Pap smear results suggesting HSIL and the positive high-risk HPV test signal a risk for more significant cervical disease, despite the biopsy showing only CIN 1.\n\nIn this context, current guidelines typically recommend an excisional procedure like a Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) as the appropriate next step. This strategy helps ensure that any potential higher-grade lesions are adequately assessed and treated, which could have been missed by the biopsy. LEEP not only serves a diagnostic purpose by providing a more comprehensive tissue sample for histological examination but also has a therapeutic role by removing abnormal tissue.\n\nThus, performing a LEEP would be aligned with standard practices to manage HSIL findings in combination with CIN 1, particularly when high-risk HPV is involved and in a patient who is 38 years old. This proactive approach helps in mitigating the risk of progression to more severe cervical disease."}
{"question": "Identify a condition that is not a cause of night blindness, which is related to the interference with the function of rods due to deficiency of visual purple.", "gold_answer": "The condition that is not a cause of night blindness related to the interference with the function of rods due to a deficiency of visual purple (rhodopsin) is glaucoma. Glaucoma primarily affects the optic nerve and does not directly impact the production or functionality of rhodopsin in the rod cells."}
{"question": "List the conditions in which increased density in the skull vault is observed.", "gold_answer": "Increased density in the skull vault can be observed in several conditions, including:\n\n1. **Paget's Disease**: This condition involves excessive bone remodeling, leading to thicker and denser bones.\n   \n2. **Osteopetrosis**: A genetic disorder where bone resorption is impaired, resulting in abnormally dense bone throughout the body, including the skull.\n\n3. **Hyperostosis Frontalis Interna**: Most commonly seen in postmenopausal women, this condition affects the frontal bone, increasing its thickness and density.\n\n4. **Skeletal Fluorosis**: Excessive fluoride exposure can result in increased bone density, including in the skull.\n\n5. **Prostatic Cancer Metastasis**: When prostate cancer metastasizes to the bones, it often causes sclerotic lesions, increasing bone density.\n\nOther conditions, like hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, and the effects of certain medications (such as excess vitamin A), can have complex effects on bone density, sometimes leading to increased density in particular scenarios. However, these cases can vary and may not uniformly cause increased skull density."}

Given the history of symmetrical small joint arthritis and deformities, it is suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis, which is known to be associated with interstitial lung disease. The symptoms of shortness of breath on exertion, dry cough, loud P2 heart sound, and fine bibasilar crackles further support this diagnosis."}
{"question": "During an exhumation, only a skull bone was found with the basiocciput fused with the basisphenoid. What is the approximate age of the individual at the time of death?", "gold_answer": "Based on the detail provided that the basiocciput is fused with the basisphenoid, the individual was likely between 17 and 25 years old at the time of death. This fusion typically completes during this age range, indicating the person had reached late adolescence to early adulthood."}
{"question": "If a patient presents with the eye deviated laterally and downwards and is unable to look up or medially, which cranial nerve is likely involved?", "gold_answer": "The cranial nerve likely involved in the situation you described is the oculomotor nerve, which is cranial nerve III. This nerve controls the muscles that move the eye medially towards the nose and upwards, and its dysfunction could lead to the eye being deviated laterally and downward, with the inability to look up or medially."}
{"question": "Which among the following  differentiates ventricular tachycardia  from WPW Patient with atrial fibrillation\nA. Irregular RR interval\nB. Regular RR interval\nC. Broad QRS\nD. Increased heart rate", "gold_answer": "The distinguishing feature between ventricular tachycardia (VT) and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome with atrial fibrillation is the regularity of the RR interval. Ventricular tachycardia is characterized by a regular RR interval, whereas WPW with atrial fibrillation shows an irregular RR interval due to the chaotic signaling. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Regular RR interval"}
{"question": "If a carotid transducer is not functioning, which specific measurements related to left ventricular function could not be obtained?", "gold_answer": "If a carotid transducer is not functioning, specific measurements related to left ventricular function that could not be obtained include left ventricular ejection time (LVET) and pre-ejection period (PEP). These measurements are derived from analyzing the carotid pulse waveforms, which reflect the timing of cardiac events related to left ventricular function. Without the transducer, the ability to assess these timing aspects through carotid arterial flow is compromised."}

{"question": "A 25-day-old neonate presents with cyanosis, sweating, and feeding difficulties, and has a mother with a history of taking medication for bipolar disorder during the first trimester. Upon examination, a holosystolic murmur is heard parasternally at the left 4th intercostal space, which intensifies with inspiration, and S3 and S4 heart sounds are present. What embryological remnant is associated with this condition?", "gold_answer": "The presentation and details you provided strongly suggest that the neonate is suffering from Ebstein's anomaly, a heart defect commonly associated with maternal use of lithium, a medication often prescribed for bipolar disorder. Ebstein's anomaly is characterized by an abnormality of the tricuspid valve, which is displaced downward into the right ventricle, affecting normal heart function.\n\nEmbryologically, this condition is linked to improper development of the tricuspid valve, which initially develops from the endocardial cushions and related structures in the heart's primitive atrium. Therefore, the associated embryological remnant for this condition is the abnormal development associated with the primitive atrium, affecting how the tricuspid valve forms and functions."}
{"question": "Several weeks after suffering from a severe streptococcal sore throat, a 7-year-old boy develops acute glomerulonephritis. Describe the hemolytic properties and antibiotic susceptibility of the most likely causative streptococcal organism responsible for this condition.", "gold_answer": "The most likely causative organism responsible for the 7-year-old boy's acute glomerulonephritis following a severe sore throat is Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as Group A Streptococcus (GAS). This bacterium is characterized by its beta-hemolytic properties, which means it completely lyses red blood cells. When cultured on blood agar plates, Streptococcus pyogenes produces a clear zone of hemolysis around its colonies due to its ability to completely break down the red blood cells.\n\nRegarding antibiotic susceptibility, Streptococcus pyogenes is typically susceptible to penicillin, which remains the antibiotic of choice for treating infections caused by this bacterium. Fortunately, Streptococcus pyogenes has not developed significant resistance to penicillin, making it an effective treatment option."}

The key indicators pointing towards a medial meniscus tear include the knee locking sensation, medial joint tenderness, and the subtle clicking observed with passive movement. These symptoms align typically with meniscal damage, particularly on the medial side of the knee. The absence of anterior displacement on the anterior drawer test helps in ruling out an ACL tear, and the specific tenderness and symptoms do not support involvement of the collateral ligaments. Therefore, the medial meniscus is the most probable source of the issues described."}
{"question": "At what concentration levels in the blood does respiratory failure typically occur in cases of carboxyhemoglobin due to carbon monoxide poisoning and CO2 concentration in carbon dioxide poisoning?", "gold_answer": "In cases of carbon monoxide poisoning, respiratory failure typically occurs at carboxyhemoglobin levels exceeding 50-60%. This is because carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin, severely impairing the blood's ability to transport oxygen to tissues and organs.\n\nOn the other hand, in carbon dioxide poisoning, respiratory failure is associated with elevated CO2 levels in the blood. The normal range for partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) is 35-45 mmHg. Respiratory failure is likely to occur when CO2 levels rise to around 70-80 mmHg, leading to a condition called respiratory acidosis, which affects both respiratory function and the central nervous system. Both conditions are serious and require immediate medical attention to prevent severe outcomes."}
{"question": "Ramu is a 60-year-old male with CA Descending colon presents with acute intestinal obstruction. In emergency department t/t of choice is -\nA. Defunctioning colostomy\nB. Hartman's procedure\nC. Total colectomy\nD. Lt hemicolectomy", "gold_answer": "In the scenario where Ramu, a 60-year-old with cancer in the descending colon, presents with an acute intestinal obstruction, the treatment choice in an emergency setting is critical. Considering the need to both relieve the obstruction and address the cancer while being mindful of his potentially unstable condition, Hartman's procedure emerges as a wise choice. \n\nHartman's procedure involves resecting the diseased segment, in this case, the affected part of the colon, and creating an end colostomy. This effectively addresses the obstruction and manages the tumor without the immediate need for rejoining the bowel, which could be precarious if the patient is unstable. It allows for a safer, staged approach that can be crucial in the context of an emergency. \n\nThus, the treatment of choice in this emergency situation would be B. Hartman's procedure."}
{"question": "A 22-year-old woman experiences involuntary loss of urine one day after giving birth to a large newborn. The urine loss happens without an urge and is not worsened by sneezing or coughing. Considering her history of prolonged labor, epidural analgesia, and current physical examination findings including a distended tender abdomen and extended uterus, what is the most likely cause of her urinary incontinence?", "gold_answer": "The most likely cause of the urinary incontinence in this 22-year-old woman, given her history of prolonged labor, epidural analgesia, and current symptoms of a distended and tender abdomen, is overflow incontinence due to urinary retention. The epidural analgesia can temporarily affect bladder sensation and nerve function, contributing to the inability to sense a full bladder. Coupled with prolonged labor, which can stretch and affect the bladder's ability to contract, this situation can lead to an overfilled bladder that leaks involuntarily, as the signs of significant urinary retention match her described symptoms. This scenario often occurs when the bladder is not adequately managed following childbirth, such as with timely catheterization to alleviate retention issues."}
{"question": "What drug is given to a patient with alcohol dependence that causes an adverse reaction if alcohol is consumed?", "gold_answer": "The drug given to a patient with alcohol dependence that causes an adverse reaction if alcohol is consumed is Disulfiram. Disulfiram works by interfering with the metabolism of alcohol, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde, which results in unpleasant symptoms like flushing, nausea, and vomiting when alcohol is consumed. This reaction helps deter individuals from drinking alcohol."}
{"question": "In the dark phase of the visual cycle, which specific form of vitamin A binds with opsin to form Rhodopsin?", "gold_answer": "In the dark phase of the visual cycle, the specific form of vitamin A that binds with opsin to form rhodopsin is 11-cis-retinal. This form of retinal combines with opsin to regenerate rhodopsin, allowing rods in the eyes to function effectively in low-light conditions. This conversion and binding process is crucial for maintaining vision in dim environments."}

{"question": "In a case where a thrombus is located in the posterior cerebral artery of a 62-year-old male patient experiencing a stroke, which structure would not typically be affected by this lesion?", "gold_answer": "In the case of a thrombus located in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), the pons would not typically be affected by this lesion. The pons, which plays important roles in functions like regulating sleep and basic life functions, primarily receives its blood supply from the basilar artery rather than the PCA. Thus, despite the stroke due to the thrombus in the PCA, the pons remains unaffected."}
{"question": "What is the most common causative organism responsible for fever and productive cough in a 60-year-old male patient developing symptoms 48 hours after being admitted to the ICU?", "gold_answer": "In a hospital or ICU setting, when a patient develops symptoms such as fever and productive cough 48 hours after admission, this is typically considered hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). In these environments, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is indeed one of the most common causative organisms responsible for such infections. This bacterium, known for its resilience and adaptability in healthcare settings, thrives in moist environments and can lead to severe respiratory infections, especially in patients with compromised health. Therefore, given the context of the ICU environment and the timing of symptom onset, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a likely suspect in this scenario."}
{"question": "When a neurologic examination reveals bilateral medial rectus paresis on attempted lateral gaze, monocular horizontal nystagmus in the abducting eye, and unimpaired convergence, where is the lesion most likely located?", "gold_answer": "The lesion is most likely located in the bilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). This structure in the brainstem is crucial for coordinating horizontal eye movements and is typically implicated in cases of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which aligns with the symptoms described: bilateral medial rectus paresis on attempted lateral gaze, monocular horizontal nystagmus in the abducting eye, and preserved convergence. In INO, the communication between the abducens and oculomotor nerves is disrupted, affecting coordinated lateral gaze but sparing convergence because the latter does not rely on the MLF."}
{"question": "Based on the findings of a unilateral ovarian tumor with ascites positive for malignant cells and positive pelvic lymph nodes, while all other structures are free of disease, what is the stage of the ovarian cancer according to the FIGO staging system?", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided—a unilateral ovarian tumor with ascites positive for malignant cells and positive pelvic lymph nodes, while all other structures remain free of disease—the stage of the ovarian cancer according to the FIGO staging system would be Stage IIIA1(ii). This stage accounts for tumor involvement in pelvic lymph nodes and reflects malignant cells found in ascites, indicating spread beyond the ovary within the pelvic region without visible metastatic implants outside the pelvis."}
{"question": "A patient Rasmu presents with eye deviated laterally and slightly downward. The upward gaze is impaired and medial rotation is not possible. Which nerve is involved.\nA. III\nB. IV\nC. VI\nD. All", "gold_answer": "A. III\n\nThe symptoms described—Rasmu's eye being deviated laterally and slightly downward, coupled with impaired upward gaze and inability to medially rotate the eye—point towards an issue with the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). This nerve controls most of the eye's movements, along with the lifting of the eyelid. A dysfunction here would explain the outward and downward deviation due to the unopposed action of the lateral rectus (controlled by cranial nerve VI) and the superior oblique (controlled by cranial nerve IV), and why the eye cannot move upward or medially."}
{"question": "What is the treatment of choice for nodules at the junction of the anterior 1/3rd and middle 1/3rd of the vocal cords in a 30-year-old female with a history of singing, vocal abuse, and gastroesophageal reflux?", "gold_answer": "The treatment of choice for vocal nodules in a singer, especially with accompanying issues like vocal abuse and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), is primarily voice therapy. Voice therapy is a non-surgical approach that focuses on teaching optimal voice production techniques to reduce stress on the vocal cords, promote healing, and prevent future nodule formation. \n\nGiven the patient's GERD, managing this condition is also crucial for effective treatment. This often involves lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes to reduce acid reflux, and possibly medication like proton pump inhibitors to decrease stomach acid production.\n\nSurgery is typically considered only if nodules persist despite comprehensive non-surgical interventions. Therefore, a combination of tailored voice therapy and GERD management is the best approach to address her vocal nodules."}
{"question": "Which hormone is the secretion controlled by the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus?", "gold_answer": "The supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus primarily controls the secretion of vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This hormone plays a crucial role in regulating the body's water balance by influencing the kidneys' ability to reabsorb water. Additionally, the supraoptic nucleus also synthesizes oxytocin, which is involved in various functions such as childbirth and bonding. However, vasopressin is most strongly associated with the supraoptic nucleus in terms of its core physiological functions."}

{"question": "What is the alveolar bone proper seen as in an IOPA radiograph?", "gold_answer": "In an Intraoral Periapical (IOPA) radiograph, the alveolar bone proper is seen as the lamina dura. The lamina dura appears as a thin, radiopaque (white) line outlining the tooth sockets. This distinct appearance helps in identifying healthy and stable tooth anchoring in the jaw."}
{"question": "What is the most appropriate first line treatment for a 25-year-old infertile woman presenting with menorrhagia and an immobile abdominal mass, with fixed uterus and appendages on pelvic examination?", "gold_answer": "Given the presentation of menorrhagia, infertility, and an immobile abdominal mass with a fixed uterus and appendages upon pelvic examination, surgical exploration is a key step in management. The most appropriate first-line treatment in this scenario is a diagnostic laparoscopy. This minimally invasive surgery allows for direct visualization of the pelvic organs, diagnosis of conditions such as endometriosis or fibroids, and potential treatment, such as adhesiolysis, excision of endometriosis, or myomectomy, which can not only aid in managing symptoms but also help improve fertility outcomes."}
{"question": "A 65-year-old man has been experiencing back pain for the past three months. He presents with marked stiffness, mild restriction of chest movements, elevated ESR, and x-ray findings showing syndesmophytes in the vertebrae. What is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 65-year-old man experiencing these symptoms is ankylosing spondylitis. This condition is characterized by chronic back pain and stiffness due to inflammation, typically involving the sacroiliac joints and spine, and can lead to the formation of syndesmophytes, as seen on his x-ray. The mild restriction of chest movements can also be attributed to involvement of the costovertebral joints, commonly associated with this condition. Although ankylosing spondylitis often presents earlier in life, it can sometimes be diagnosed later, especially if symptoms have progressively developed or have been misinterpreted. The elevated ESR further supports an inflammatory process, aligning well with ankylosing spondylitis."}
{"question": "A 45-year-old woman involved in a high-speed motor vehicle accident arrives at the emergency department with multiple injuries, is profusely bleeding, and is in a critical condition with low blood pressure. Her husband informs the medical team that she is a Jehovah's Witness and does not wish to receive blood transfusions, but there are no advanced directives available. What is the appropriate immediate action for the medical team to take regarding transfusions in this critical scenario?", "gold_answer": "In this highly sensitive situation, the appropriate immediate action for the medical team is to refrain from administering a blood transfusion. Instead, they should focus on alternative treatments to stabilize the patient while respecting her religious beliefs as communicated by her husband. This involves utilizing non-blood medical interventions such as volume expanders and medications that help with clotting to manage her condition as much as possible within the limits set by her faith.\n\nIt is crucial in healthcare to respect patient autonomy and beliefs, particularly when there's strong indication from a family member about the patient's wishes, as seen in this case with her being identified as a Jehovah's Witness. This requires a delicate balancing act between providing life-saving treatment and respecting the patient's religious convictions. Therefore, the medical team should prioritize exploring and employing all possible alternatives to blood transfusions while continually assessing her situation for the best possible outcomes."}
{"question": "What condition in a pregnant woman at 32 weeks and 3 days with vaginal bleeding and a placenta previa allows for conservative management?", "gold_answer": "Conservative management is an option in cases where the pregnant woman with placenta previa is stable, meaning she shows no signs of shock and maintains stable vital signs (like blood pressure and pulse). Additionally, the fetal condition should be stable, with reassuring heart rate patterns and no signs of distress. The bleeding should be mild or have stopped, and there should be no active labor or contractions present. The type of placenta previa also plays a role, as marginal placenta previa is less risky than complete previa. Continued hospitalization and monitoring are essential to ensure the safety of both the mother and baby. If all these conditions are met, conservative management can be pursued, typically involving careful observation in a hospital setting to manage any potential changes swiftly."}

This approach helps mimic the microgravity conditions they will experience in space, thereby aligning the preflight data more closely with their in-flight experiences and providing a more accurate basis for comparison with their post-flight measurements taken back on Earth."}
{"question": "A person with type 1 diabetes ran out of her prescription insulin and has not been able to inject insulin for the past 3 days. An overproduction of which of the following could cause a metabolic acidosis?\nA. Hb\nB. Ketone bodies\nC. HCl\nD. Bicarbonate", "gold_answer": "The correct answer is B. Ketone bodies.\n\nIn type 1 diabetes, when there is an absence of insulin, the body cannot utilize glucose for energy effectively, leading it to break down fat to meet its energy needs. This process results in the production of ketone bodies, namely acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone. If these ketone bodies accumulate excessively in the bloodstream, they can lead to a dangerous state known as diabetic ketoacidosis, a form of metabolic acidosis where the blood becomes too acidic. Hemoglobin, hydrochloric acid, and bicarbonate are not directly responsible for the metabolic acidosis observed in this scenario."}
{"question": "What are the characteristics of cholestasis of pregnancy?", "gold_answer": "Cholestasis of pregnancy, also known as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), is a liver disorder that typically occurs in the third trimester. It is characterized primarily by intense itching, particularly on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, often without the presence of a rash. This itching can be quite severe and is one of the most notable symptoms of the condition.\n\nBiochemically, cholestasis of pregnancy involves the impairment of bile flow which leads to the accumulation of bile acids in the bloodstream. This can be confirmed through laboratory tests showing elevated serum bile acids. Liver function tests may also reveal increased levels of enzymes such as alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), indicating liver stress or damage.\n\nThe condition poses several risks if left unmanaged, notably for the baby. Potential complications include preterm birth, fetal distress, and in severe untreated cases, stillbirth. As a result, careful monitoring and management are essential. Treatment often involves the use of ursodeoxycholic acid to decrease bile acids levels and alleviate itching. In some cases, early delivery may be considered to reduce the risk to the baby.\n\nOverall, the key characteristics of cholestasis of pregnancy include severe itching, elevated bile acids, and liver enzyme abnormalities during pregnancy, necessitating prompt diagnosis and management to prevent adverse outcomes for the mother and baby."}

{"question": "What drug is recommended for preventing HIV transmission from an HIV positive pregnant mother to her child?", "gold_answer": "To prevent HIV transmission from an HIV-positive pregnant mother to her child, the current best practice is the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout pregnancy, during delivery, and while breastfeeding. The recommended regimen typically includes tenofovir, combined with either lamivudine or emtricitabine, and efavirenz. This approach effectively reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV by maintaining a low viral load in the mother. It's essential to follow healthcare providers' guidance and the latest protocols to ensure the best outcomes for both mother and child."}
{"question": "What three treatments are commonly used for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) according to standard medical practice?", "gold_answer": "The three treatments commonly used for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) according to standard medical practice are chemotherapy, corticosteroids, and stem cell transplantation. Chemotherapy is the primary treatment and is typically planned in stages: induction, consolidation, and maintenance. Corticosteroids are often used alongside chemotherapy to help reduce inflammation and target leukemia cells, especially in the initial treatment phase. Stem cell transplantation is considered for patients who do not respond well to initial treatments or who have a high risk of relapse, serving as a powerful option for cases that don't adequately respond to chemotherapy alone."}
{"question": "A 52-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 year after an uncomplicated liver transplantation. He feels well but wants to know how long he can expect his donor graft to function. The physician informs him that the odds of graft survival are 90% at 1 year, 78% at 5 years, and 64% at 10 years. At this time, the probability of the patient's graft surviving to 10 years after transplantation is closest to which of the following?\nA. 64%\nB. 82%\nC. 71%\nD. 58%\nE. 45%", "gold_answer": "The probability of the patient's graft surviving to 10 years, considering it has already successfully made it through the first year, is a matter of conditional probability. Given the survival probabilities provided:\n\n- 90% chance of survival at 1 year\n- 64% chance of survival at 10 years\n\nTo find the probability of making it from year 1 to year 10, we divide the probability of surviving to 10 years by the probability of surviving to 1 year:\n\n\\[ \\text{Conditional Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Probability of surviving to 10 years}}{\\text{Probability of surviving to 1 year}} = \\frac{0.64}{0.90} \\approx 0.711 \\]\n\nConverted to a percentage, this results in approximately 71.1%. Hence, the best approximation for the probability that the graft will survive to 10 years from now, given that it has already survived the first year, is 71%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 71%"}
{"question": "An 18-month-old girl is brought to the emergency room by her mother because of wheezing for 1 day. The baby has never had similar symptoms. She also has a runny nose and a cough. She is not feeding well. Her immunizations are up-to-date. Her rectal temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F), the heart rate is 120/min, and the respiratory rate is 23/min. On examination, a clear nasal discharge is noticed with intercostal retractions. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral fine rales and diffuse fine wheezing. A chest X-ray is given in the exhibit. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n \nA. Bronchial asthma\nB. Bronchiolitis\nC. Bacterial pneumonia\nD. Bronchial foreign body\nE. Croup", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 18-month-old girl is B. Bronchiolitis. This condition is common in young children, particularly those around her age, and is often caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The presence of wheezing, a history of runny nose and cough with a low-grade fever, and the absence of a previous history of similar symptoms align well with bronchiolitis. The diffuse wheezing and bilateral fine rales observed during chest auscultation further support this diagnosis, while other options like asthma, bacterial pneumonia, a bronchial foreign body, and croup are less consistent with her presentation and symptom onset."}
{"question": "An 8-month-old boy presents with symptoms of poor feeding, lethargy, floppy muscles, ptosis, and sluggish pupillary reflexes after recent introduction to pureed foods. Considering his medical history and symptoms, what is the pathophysiological mechanism underlying his condition?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms you're describing in the 8-month-old boy—poor feeding, lethargy, muscle floppiness (hypotonia), droopy eyelids (ptosis), and sluggish pupillary reflexes—are consistent with infant botulism. \n\nThe pathophysiological mechanism underlying his condition is the action of botulinum toxin interfering with neuromuscular transmission. Botulinum toxin, produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, blocks the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Acetylcholine is critical for muscle contraction, so when its release is inhibited, it leads to muscle weakness and flaccidity, seen as hypotonia and ptosis. The change in diet to include pureed foods could have introduced the toxin if the food was improperly stored or prepared, allowing the bacteria to produce the toxin. This could explain the rapid onset of symptoms following the dietary change. \n\nImmediate medical evaluation and treatment are crucial, as botulism can be life-threatening if not treated promptly."}
{"question": "A syndrome caused by chromosomal anomalies is being researched in the immunology laboratory. Several congenital conditions are observed among the participating patients, mostly involving the thymus and the heart. Common facial features of affected individuals are shown in the image below.

Aplasia refers to the complete lack of development of the organ, which aligns with the absence of T cells observed in your flow cytometry analysis."}
{"question": "Given a 58-year-old female with a history of intermittent non-bloody diarrhea following a raw food diet, recent travel to Uganda, a new systolic ejection murmur, and no significant alcohol or tobacco use, what nutritional deficiency is she at risk of developing, considering her symptoms and dietary habits?", "gold_answer": "Given the details provided, the 58-year-old woman on a raw food diet who recently traveled to Uganda and is experiencing intermittent non-bloody diarrhea and a new systolic ejection murmur is at risk of developing Vitamin B12 and iron deficiencies. These nutrients are typically lower in a raw food diet, which might lack adequate sources of B12 found in animal products and readily absorbed iron. Both of these deficiencies can lead to anemia, potentially causing symptoms such as a systolic murmur due to increased cardiac demand. Moreover, her travel history suggests that any gastrointestinal disturbance from infectious causes could further exacerbate malabsorption of these critical nutrients. While niacin deficiency (pellagra) could present with diarrhea, a new heart murmur is more strongly associated with the anemia of either iron or B12 deficiency."}
{"question": "In a medical diagnosis where one kidney appears normal and the other is contracted and scarred, what is the most probable condition responsible for this presentation?", "gold_answer": "The most probable condition responsible for the presentation where one kidney appears normal while the other is contracted and scarred is chronic pyelonephritis. This often occurs due to vesicoureteral reflux or recurrent urinary tract infections affecting one kidney, leading to scarring and contraction over time."}
{"question": "A patient underwent surgical treatment for bilateral pheochromocytoma and later developed gait abnormality. An MRI of the head was performed. Based on these clinical findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a patient who underwent surgical treatment for bilateral pheochromocytoma and subsequently developed a gait abnormality is Von Hippel-Lindau disease. This condition is characterized by the development of tumors and cysts in different parts of the body, including pheochromocytomas and hemangioblastomas in the central nervous system. The presence of bilateral pheochromocytomas and the new onset of a neurological symptom, such as a gait abnormality, strongly suggest Von Hippel-Lindau disease.

Decreased serum progesterone and increased serum testosterone", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and test results you described are indicative of menopause, which aligns with the age and clinical presentation of the patient. In menopause, decreased estrogen production from the ovaries results in low levels of estradiol. This decrease in estrogen causes the pituitary gland to increase the production of FSH and LH as the body attempts to stimulate the ovaries. Therefore, the most likely additional laboratory findings in this patient would be decreased serum estradiol and increased serum LH. \n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. Decreased serum estradiol and increased serum LH."}
{"question": "What is the preferred treatment approach for a 60-year-old patient diagnosed with maxillary carcinoma involving the anterolateral part of the maxilla?", "gold_answer": "The preferred treatment approach for a 60-year-old patient with maxillary carcinoma involving the anterolateral part of the maxilla typically involves a comprehensive, multidisciplinary strategy. The mainstay of treatment often starts with surgical intervention, such as a maxillectomy, to remove the tumor and achieve clear margins while being mindful of the functional and aesthetic impacts.\n\nFollowing surgery, radiotherapy is commonly employed to target any residual cancer cells and reduce the risk of recurrence. This is particularly vital given the complex anatomical location and the proximity to critical facial structures. Chemotherapy may also be considered, especially if the cancer is advanced or exhibits aggressive characteristics.\n\nOverall, the treatment plan should be customized based on the tumor specifics, overall health of the patient, and their personal preferences. Collaborative input from various medical specialists, including surgical oncologists, radiologists, and medical oncologists, is essential to optimize the outcomes for the patient while maintaining quality of life."}

Schedule an appointment for electroconvulsive therapy", "gold_answer": "The best course of management for this patient is to \"Come back for a follow-up in 2 weeks\" (Option C). Given that the symptoms described align with typical post-partum blues, which is common and generally resolves itself in a couple of weeks, an immediate intensive intervention isn't necessary. Following up in two weeks allows for monitoring her emotional state to ensure it doesn't progress into something more serious, like post-partum depression, while providing support and reassurance in the meantime."}
{"question": "What is the frequency of sterilization services provided at a district hospital during Fixed Day Static services (FDS), and why is it considered incorrect among the given options?", "gold_answer": "During Fixed Day Static services (FDS) at a district hospital, sterilization services are typically not provided on a daily basis. The daily provision of such services is considered incorrect because it would demand constant resource allocation, which isn't practical given the hospital's need to manage staffing, equipment, and scheduling effectively. Instead, these services are usually scheduled on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, which allows for better planning and resource management while ensuring that patients have regular access to the services they need."}
{"question": "A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department with joint pain and a rash, along with a fever of 101°F. He reports being sexually active and occasionally using cocaine. The physical exam reveals pustular skin lesions and an inflamed, painful right knee. Considering these symptoms and the patient's lifestyle, what is the most appropriate treatment for the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms presented by the 33-year-old man—joint pain, rash, fever, and the finding of pustular skin lesions alongside his sexual activity—the clinical picture fits well with Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI). This condition is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which can lead to arthritis and dermatological manifestations. Given this likely diagnosis, the most appropriate treatment is intravenous ceftriaxone, which is highly effective against gonococcal infections. \n\nAdditionally, due to the common co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, it is prudent to also treat with oral doxycycline to cover for this possibility. Thus, a dual treatment strategy with IV ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline is recommended to address both the immediate infection and potential co-infections, in accordance with current guidelines for managing sexually transmitted infections with potential complications."}
{"question": "A 60-year-old man with bipolar disorder, controlled for 15 years, started a new medication 10 days ago and experienced a 3-minute episode of myoclonic jerking movements and urinary incontinence, followed by confusion and disorientation. What medication is most likely responsible for precipitating this condition, considering the symptoms observed during the physical examination?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms you described—myoclonic jerking movements, urinary incontinence, and subsequent confusion—are indicative of a seizure. Given that the man has recently begun a new medication for his bipolar disorder, it is important to consider medications that are known to lower the seizure threshold.\n\nIn the context of treating bipolar disorder, one medication that stands out for its potential to induce seizures is bupropion. Although primarily an antidepressant, bupropion is sometimes used in bipolar disorder, especially for managing depressive episodes. However, it is well-documented for its ability to lower the seizure threshold, particularly if started at a high dose or if the dose is increased rapidly.\n\nConsidering this and your description of the situation, bupropion is the most likely medication responsible for precipitating the seizure episode you observed."}

{"question": "A 27-year-old G1P0 woman at 25 weeks estimated gestational age presents with severe hypertension that is managed with an injectable antihypertensive. She later develops joint pain and tests positive for anti-histone antibodies. What is the mechanism of action of the intravenous antihypertensive medication that was likely used in her treatment?", "gold_answer": "The intravenous antihypertensive medication likely used in her treatment is hydralazine. The mechanism of action of hydralazine involves direct vasodilation of arterioles by relaxing vascular smooth muscle. This action reduces peripheral vascular resistance and subsequently lowers blood pressure. In rare cases, hydralazine can lead to drug-induced lupus erythematosus, which aligns with the patient's symptoms of joint pain and the presence of anti-histone antibodies."}
{"question": "Which organism and condition are associated with the production of asteroid bodies and cigar-shaped globi?", "gold_answer": "The organism associated with the production of asteroid bodies and cigar-shaped yeast forms, known as globi, is **Sporothrix schenckii**. The condition linked to these structures is **sporotrichosis**, which is often called \"Rose Gardener's Disease\" due to its association with skin infections acquired through handling plants and soil."}
{"question": "In a person with Eumycotic mycetoma showing a white, lobulated granule composed of fungal hyphae in the foot tissue, what is the most common etiologic agent species responsible for this condition?", "gold_answer": "The most common etiologic agent responsible for eumycotic mycetoma, characterized by the presence of white, lobulated granules in the foot tissue, is Pseudallescheria boydii, also known as Scedosporium apiospermum. This fungus is well-documented for causing infections with such white grains, making it the likely culprit in the scenario described."}
{"question": "A 43-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Four months ago, he was treated conservatively for ureteric colic. He has noticed during micturition that his urine is reddish-brown initially and then clears by the end of the stream. He has no dysuria. He has hypertension. His only medication is hydrochlorothiazide. He appears healthy and well-nourished. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 122/86 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 14.1 g/dL\nSerum\nGlucose 88 mg/dL\nCreatinine 0.6 mg/dL\nUrine\nBlood 2+\nProtein negative\nLeukocyte esterase negative\nNitrite negative\nRBCs 5–7/hpf\nWBCs 0–1/hpf\nRBC casts none\nWhich of the following is the most likely origin of this patient's hematuria?\"\nA. Renal glomeruli\nB. Ureter\nC. Renal pelvis\nD. Urethra\nE. Urinary bladder\n\"", "gold_answer": "The explanation you've provided aligns with the pattern of the hematuria observed. When blood is present in the urine at the beginning but clears towards the end of urination, it typically suggests a bleeding source that is distal in the urinary tract, such as the urethra. This localized initial bleeding is most often associated with issues in the urethra, rather than the kidneys, bladder, or ureters. Therefore, the most likely origin of this patient's hematuria is the urethra.\n\n**Answer: D. Urethra**"}
{"question": "In a middle-aged diabetic patient who has undergone tooth extraction, what condition is indicated by ipsilateral swelling over the middle one-third of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and displacement of the tonsils towards the contralateral side?", "gold_answer": "The condition indicated by ipsilateral swelling over the middle one-third of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and displacement of the tonsils towards the contralateral side in a middle-aged diabetic patient who has recently undergone a tooth extraction is likely a parapharyngeal abscess. This type of abscess can occur after dental procedures, especially in patients with diabetes, due to compromised immune responses that make them more susceptible to spreading infections. The swelling and tonsillar displacement are characteristic of space-occupying lesions like abscesses in the neck region."}
{"question": "What is the likely diagnosis for a 15-year-old boy presenting with a unilateral nasal mass, nasal blockage, and epistaxis?", "gold_answer": "The likely diagnosis for a 15-year-old boy presenting with a unilateral nasal mass, nasal blockage, and epistaxis is juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA). This benign but locally aggressive vascular tumor is almost exclusively found in adolescent males and typically presents with the symptoms you've described. Given the age and specific symptom presentation, JNA stands out as the most probable condition."}
{"question": "A 10-year-old child exhibits anemia, recurrent fractures, and X-ray findings of diffuse hyperdensity of bone. What is the most likely diagnosis given these clinical and radiological features?", "gold_answer": "The clinical and radiological features described for the 10-year-old child are highly suggestive of osteopetrosis. Osteopetrosis is a rare bone disorder characterized by the abnormal densification of bones because of defective osteoclast function, leading to impaired bone resorption. This condition often results in anemia due to reduced marrow spaces necessary for normal hematopoiesis, and causes bones to become brittle, leading to recurrent fractures despite their increased density on X-ray images. The combination of anemia, recurrent fractures, and diffuse hyperdensity of bones observed in the child fits well with the diagnosis of osteopetrosis."}
{"question": "A 39-year-old man with a history of opioid-use disorder presents with signs and symptoms such as lower extremity edema, fatigue, hematuria, and high blood pressure. Laboratory findings show proteinuria, dysmorphic red blood cells, and decreased serum complement levels, specifically C3 and C4. Considering these clinical and laboratory findings, what would be the characteristic finding on a renal biopsy in this patient?", "gold_answer": "In this patient, given the clinical presentation and lab findings suggestive of a nephritic syndrome accompanied by low serum complement levels, the most likely diagnosis is membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). On a renal biopsy, the characteristic finding for MPGN would be the 'tram-track' appearance, which is due to the duplication of the glomerular basement membrane caused by mesangial cell proliferation. This appearance is a hallmark of MPGN and correlates well with the information provided in the case."}
{"question": "What is the most probable diagnosis for a maxillary permanent central incisor with a small hypoplastic spot on the labial surface in a 9-year-old child, with a history of a fall at age 4 that resulted in a fracture of the maxillary primary incisor?", "gold_answer": "The most probable diagnosis for the maxillary permanent central incisor with a small hypoplastic spot in this scenario is Turner’s hypoplasia. This condition occurs when trauma to the primary tooth, such as the fracture at age 4, affects the development of the underlying permanent tooth, resulting in localized enamel defects. In this case, the history of trauma and the clinical presentation align well with Turner’s hypoplasia, as it typically presents as enamel hypoplasia localized to the area corresponding to the site of the injury."}
{"question": "Given the incidence numbers of malaria in an area as 20, 20, 50, 56, 60, 5000, 678, 898, 345, and 456, which statistical method should be used to determine a representative average that accounts for outliers in the dataset?", "gold_answer": "To determine a representative average for the malaria incidence data that accounts for outliers, the median is the most suitable statistical method. The median, which is the middle value in an ordered dataset, effectively minimizes the influence of extreme values, such as the large outlier \"5000\" present in your data. By focusing on the middle of the distribution, the median provides a more accurate and stable measure of central tendency for data sets with significant outliers. Thus, using the median gives a fairer picture of what's typical for the incidence numbers you have."}
{"question": "What is the cause of the infection in a patient who presents with fever, chills, and a maculopapular rash on the trunk spreading peripherally, occurring 2 weeks after a louse bite?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms you've described—fever, chills, and a maculopapular rash that starts on the trunk and spreads outward, occurring about two weeks after a louse bite—are highly indicative of epidemic typhus. This disease is caused by the bacterium Rickettsia prowazekii, which is transmitted by the human body louse. The timeline and symptomatology you've outlined align well with a typical presentation of epidemic typhus, especially in contexts where there might be exposure to lice under crowded or unsanitary conditions."}
{"question": "In an experiment, erythrocyte precursor cells are initially treated with the compound Pb82, which blocks the first step of heme synthesis but still allows the cells to develop into erythrocytes lacking heme. When a second compound, anti-Pb82, is given to negate the effect of Pb82, why do the mature red blood cells fail to produce heme?", "gold_answer": "The mature red blood cells fail to produce heme even after the introduction of anti-Pb82 because they lack the necessary cellular machinery once they reach maturity. During their development, erythrocyte precursor cells lose their mitochondria, which are crucial for the initial steps of heme synthesis. Even when anti-Pb82 negates the effect of Pb82, the mature cells cannot produce heme because they permanently lack mitochondria. These organelles play a vital role in heme production, and without them, the red blood cells remain heme-deficient. Therefore, the timing of anti-Pb82 administration is critical; it must be given before the maturation process eliminates these necessary components."}
{"question": "This 22-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of severe pubic itch that was worst at night. What is the most appropriate topical treatment?\nA. Hydrocortisone\nB. Hydroxyzine\nC. Mupirocin\nD. Permethrin", "gold_answer": "The most appropriate topical treatment for the 22-year-old man with a severe pubic itch that worsens at night is D. Permethrin. Permethrin is effective in targeting parasites such as scabies and pubic lice, which are common causes of intense nighttime itching in the pubic area."}
{"question": "A 10 year old male child presents with pallor and h/o blood transfusion 2 months back. On investigation, Hb-4.5 gms, Total count-60,000,Platelet count-2 lakhs and CD 10+ve, CD 19+ve, CD 117 +ve, MPO +ve and CD 33 -ve. What is the most probable diagnosis?\nA. ALL\nB. AML\nC. Undifferentiated leukemia\nD. Mixed phenotypic a/c leukemia", "gold_answer": "The most probable diagnosis for the 10-year-old male child, considering the investigation results, is D. Mixed phenotypic acute leukemia (MPAL). The presence of both lymphoid marker CD 19 and myeloid marker MPO, along with the CD 10 positivity, suggests a mixed lineage. This combination rules out a straightforward diagnosis of either acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and aligns with a diagnosis of MPAL, which involves the coexistence of lymphoid and myeloid characteristics."}
{"question": "A previously healthy eight year old boy presented to the emergency depament with high grade fever, ahralgia, pruiritic erythematous rash and lymphadenopathy. He had completed 8 days out of a 10 day course of cefaclor for an upper respiratory tract infection. Which of the following possibilities should be initially suspected?\nA. Kawasaki Disease\nB. Anaphylaxis\nC. Henoch Schonlein purpura\nD. Type III Hypersensitivity Reaction", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms you've described and the timeline of the cefaclor use, the most likely possibility to initially suspect is a Type III Hypersensitivity Reaction. This kind of reaction often emerges after a period of drug intake, aligning well with the eight-day course of cefaclor. The presence of high-grade fever, joint pain, pruritic erythematous rash, and lymphadenopathy also match the typical manifestations of this immune response. Hence, option D, Type III Hypersensitivity Reaction, is the most fitting initial suspicion in this scenario."}
{"question": "A 42-year-old woman presents with an 8-month history of intermittent pain and stiffness in her hands and feet, occurring about three times a month, lasting about an hour, and accompanied by fever and myalgia. Examination shows mild swelling and tenderness of her wrists and proximal interphalangeal joints, and an x-ray shows characteristic changes. She takes ibuprofen for pain relief. Her sister has systemic lupus erythematosus. Given the clinical presentation and history, what is the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical presentation of recurring pain and stiffness in the hands and feet, particularly in the wrists and proximal interphalangeal joints, as well as the presence of fever and myalgia, the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient is rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The patient's family history of autoimmune disease further supports a potential autoimmune etiology.\n\nGiven the symptoms and the x-ray findings that suggest typical joint changes associated with RA, the primary goal of treatment should be to manage symptoms and prevent joint damage over the long term. While nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen can help with symptom relief, they do not prevent disease progression.\n\nFor long-term management of rheumatoid arthritis, the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is indicated. Methotrexate is one of the most commonly prescribed DMARDs for RA due to its efficacy in slowing disease progression and preventing joint damage. Therefore, the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient would be methotrexate."}
{"question": "A 38-year-old man presents with chest pain, difficulty breathing, and fever. His chest CT scan shows a filling defect in the pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary embolism, and he has been on psychiatric medication for 6 months. Given this clinical presentation, which antipsychotic medication is most likely to be associated with the development of a pulmonary embolism in this patient?", "gold_answer": "The antipsychotic medication most likely associated with the development of a pulmonary embolism in this patient is olanzapine. Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, has been noted in the medical literature for its potential association with venous thromboembolism, which includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The increased risk is thought to be related to factors such as weight gain and a sedentary lifestyle, which can accompany the use of this medication. While older typical antipsychotics like chlorpromazine also have cardiovascular side effect profiles, olanzapine stands out in the contemporary context concerning thromboembolic events."}
{"question": "In a 52-year-old male patient presenting with pain in the lower limbs and Doppler showing incompetence at the saphenofemoral junction with dilatation of the great saphenous vein and normal deep veins, which management option is not typically suitable?", "gold_answer": "In the case of a 52-year-old male with incompetence at the saphenofemoral junction and a dilated great saphenous vein, while his deep veins are normal, sclerotherapy is typically not suitable as a primary treatment option. Sclerotherapy is generally reserved for smaller varicose veins and spider veins, rather than larger veins like the great saphenous vein when there is significant reflux involved. Instead, treatments such as endovenous thermal ablation or surgical interventions are more appropriate for addressing the underlying venous insufficiency in such cases."}
{"question": "A 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Alzheimer's dementia, elevated pulse rate, high blood pressure, warm skin, tremor, undetectable serum thyroid stimulating hormone, and follicular atrophy in thyroid biopsy is experiencing fatigue and weight loss. Considering these symptoms and findings, what is the most likely underlying cause of her condition?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and findings in this 75-year-old woman strongly suggest that the most likely underlying cause of her condition is exogenous thyroid hormone use. The combination of undetectable serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), symptoms of hyperthyroidism (elevated pulse rate, high blood pressure, warm skin, tremor, fatigue, and weight loss), and follicular atrophy observed in the thyroid biopsy all point towards an excess intake of thyroid hormones, which can suppress the body's natural thyroid function and result in these manifestations. This is often seen when there is external ingestion of thyroid hormone, such as levothyroxine, whether it is intentional or unintentional."}
{"question": "A 25-year-old man presents with joint pain involving large joints of the legs that frequently exacerbates and is accompanied by diarrhea. What gastrointestinal disease is most likely causing the patient's joint problems?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms described—joint pain predominantly affecting the large joints of the legs coupled with episodes of diarrhea—a gastrointestinal disease like Crohn's disease is the most likely cause. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease known to manifest with extraintestinal symptoms, including peripheral arthritis, which often involves large joints. This association aligns well with the fact that inflammatory bowel diseases often appear in young adults, making Crohn's disease a strong contender as the underlying cause of the patient's joint and gastrointestinal symptoms."}
{"question": "A 39-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort for the past couple of hours. She says that the pain is dull in nature and denies any radiation. She admits to having similar episodes of pain in the past which subsided on its own. Her temperature is 37°C (99.6°F), respirations are 16/min, pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical examination is normal except for diffuse tenderness of her abdomen. She undergoes a limited abdominal ultrasound which reveals a 1.4 cm gallbladder polyp. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?\nA. Cholecystectomy\nB. Barium swallow study\nC. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\nD. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)\nE. No further treatment required", "gold_answer": "A. Cholecystectomy\n\nIn this case, the best next step for a 39-year-old woman presenting with right upper quadrant discomfort and an ultrasound revealing a 1.4 cm gallbladder polyp is a cholecystectomy. Gallbladder polyps larger than 1 cm are considered at higher risk for malignancy, and given the symptoms and the size of the polyp, surgical removal of the gallbladder is recommended to prevent potential complications including cancer. Other diagnostic or monitoring approaches, like ERCP, MRCP, or barium swallow study, are not appropriate for managing gallbladder polyps of this size."}
{"question": "If a codon consisted of 4 nucleotides instead of 3, how many unique amino acids could theoretically be encoded by this system?", "gold_answer": "If a codon consisted of 4 nucleotides instead of the usual 3, there would be 256 possible unique combinations (4 x 4 x 4 x 4). Therefore, theoretically, the system could encode up to 256 unique amino acids. This is a significant increase from the current system, which uses 64 codons to encode 20 amino acids and includes some additional codons for start and stop signals. Such an expanded genetic code could allow for a much greater diversity of proteins and biological functions."}
{"question": "In a case-control study investigating the association between breast cancer and the contraceptive pill, explain why the attributing risk of breast cancer resulting from the pill cannot be directly measured.", "gold_answer": "In a case-control study exploring the association between breast cancer and the use of the contraceptive pill, the attributable risk cannot be directly measured because of the study's retrospective and comparative nature. Attributable risk requires knowing the incidence of breast cancer in those who took the pill versus those who did not, over a defined period. In contrast, a case-control study starts with people who already have the disease (cases) and those who don’t (controls), and looks backward to see if there was prior exposure to the contraceptive pill. It does not track new cases over time, which is necessary to measure incidence. Therefore, while case-control studies can provide an odds ratio—a statistic that estimates the strength of association between exposure and disease—they lack the incidence data needed to calculate attributable risk. This inherent limitation means we can identify associations but cannot directly determine how much of the risk of breast cancer can be attributed specifically to the use of the contraceptive pill."}
{"question": "A patient in your psychiatry outpatient department presents with diminished vision, and an ophthalmological examination reveals corneal and lenticular opacities. The patient has been prescribed an antipsychotic drug. Which antipsychotic medication is known to cause corneal and lenticular opacities?", "gold_answer": "Thioridazine is an antipsychotic medication known to cause corneal and lenticular opacities."}
{"question": "A 78-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting is found deceased, with an autopsy revealing a 100% blockage of the left anterior descending artery and indications of sudden cardiac death 2 days prior. What histologic finding is expected in the myocardium if it is analyzed 2 days post-infarction?", "gold_answer": "Two days after a myocardial infarction, the histologic examination of the myocardium is expected to show the presence of an acute inflammatory response primarily characterized by infiltration of neutrophils. At this stage, there would also be signs of coagulative necrosis in the myocardial tissue. Neutrophils begin to arrive at the site of the infarct shortly after the heart attack and become increasingly prominent around 48 hours, reflecting the body's early response to the injury. Therefore, significant neutrophilic infiltration along with evidence of coagulative necrosis would be the expected histological findings in the myocardium 2 days post-infarction."}
{"question": "In the case of a perimenopausal lady with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the uterus, who presents with more than half myometrial invasion, vaginal metastasis, and inguinal lymph node metastasis, what is the correct FIGO stage for her cancer?", "gold_answer": "In the case of a perimenopausal woman with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the uterus, given the presence of more than half myometrial invasion, vaginal metastasis, and inguinal lymph node metastasis, the cancer is classified as Stage IVB according to the FIGO staging system. This designation reflects the extent of spread to distant lymph nodes, which in this scenario includes the inguinal lymph nodes."}
{"question": "Immediately after third stage of labour in a case of ful-term delivery, the fundus of the uterus is :\nA. At the leve of Xiphisternum\nB. At the leve of fumbilicus\nC. Just below the level of umbilicus\nD. Just above the symphysis pubis", "gold_answer": "Immediately after the third stage of labor in a full-term delivery, the fundus of the uterus is typically found just below the level of the umbilicus. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Just below the level of umbilicus"}
{"question": "A 55-year-old farmer presents with symptoms including fever, chills, fatigue, productive cough, sore throat, and breathlessness for 7 days. He has regular contact with rabbits and farm animals and cleaned a barn shortly before the symptoms began. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the right side, a large tender lymph node in the right axilla, and a chest radiograph shows opacities and pleural effusions. Despite this, gram stains and serology tests are negative for pathogens. Given these findings, identify the most likely causative organism for his condition.", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms and the specific context provided, the most likely causative organism for the farmer's condition is Francisella tularensis. This bacterium is known to cause tularemia, an infection that can be contracted through contact with infected animals like rabbits, as well as through environmental exposure such as cleaning animal enclosures or barns. The fact that usual tests like gram stains and serologies for common pathogens are negative suggests a less commonly screened pathogen, such as Francisella tularensis, which can sometimes require more specialized testing for detection."}
{"question": "A 58-year-old man with a history of shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary heart disease presents with labored breathing, crackles and wheezes, and an S3 heart sound. After assessing his condition and initiating treatment, a drug is prescribed to alleviate his symptoms. Identify the specific part of the nephron where this drug acts.", "gold_answer": "The drug prescribed acts on the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the nephron. This is where loop diuretics, such as furosemide, exert their effect by inhibiting the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter, helping to reduce fluid overload commonly seen in conditions like heart failure."}
{"question": "In the context of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction represented by a graph showing the effect of substrate concentration on initial velocity, what is true about the amount of enzyme present as the Enzyme-Substrate complex at point C?", "gold_answer": "At point C on a graph representing substrate concentration versus initial velocity in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, it's typically near the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the reaction. At this point, most of the enzyme is present as the enzyme-substrate complex. This is because the enzyme's active sites are nearly saturated with substrate, leading to a situation where the majority of enzyme molecules are engaged in forming complexes with the substrate. Thus, the amount of enzyme present as the enzyme-substrate complex is maximized or close to maximum at point C."}
{"question": "How would you best describe the rotational movement of the upper jaw responsible for a patient's gummy smile? ", "gold_answer": "A gummy smile due to jaw positioning is often associated with the anterior rotational movement of the upper jaw, or maxilla. This occurs when the front part of the upper jaw rotates or grows downward more than the back. This downward or anterior rotation increases the visibility of the gums when smiling, contributing to a gummy smile appearance. Addressing this issue often involves orthodontic or surgical interventions focused on adjusting or correcting the jaw's rotation or alignment to reduce gum display."}
{"question": "Which substances are not used to measure extracellular fluid (ECF) volume?", "gold_answer": "Substances that are not used to measure extracellular fluid (ECF) volume include tritiated water and Evans Blue. Tritiated water is not suitable because it distributes throughout total body water, entering both intracellular and extracellular compartments. Evans Blue is not used for ECF measurement as it binds to plasma proteins and primarily measures plasma volume, not accounting for the full extracellular space, which also includes interstitial fluid. These characteristics make them inappropriate for directly measuring ECF volume."}
{"question": "What intervention could have prevented the condition of a newborn showing right shoulder adduction and internal rotation, born to a 35-year-old woman with significant lateral neck traction required during delivery?", "gold_answer": "The newborn's condition, showing right shoulder adduction and internal rotation, is indicative of a brachial plexus injury, commonly known as Erb's palsy. This injury is often associated with shoulder dystocia during delivery, where significant lateral traction on the baby's neck may be applied.\n\nTo prevent such injuries, several interventions could have been considered. During pregnancy, effective management of maternal conditions like gestational diabetes could have been vital. This is because uncontrolled gestational diabetes can lead to fetal macrosomia, where the baby is larger than average, increasing the risk of shoulder dystocia during delivery. Proper management could include monitoring blood sugar levels and using insulin if necessary to maintain them within a healthy range.\n\nDuring delivery, prevention of excessive traction that can lead to brachial plexus injury is crucial. Employing maneuvers like the McRoberts maneuver can help resolve shoulder dystocia more safely without resorting to forceful traction. It is equally important to ensure the delivery team is well-trained and prepared to handle such scenarios effectively, possibly through simulation training.\n\nWhen potential risk factors for shoulder dystocia are identified before delivery, such as a history of previous complications or signs of fetal macrosomia, engaging in thorough prenatal care and considering delivery options, including elective cesarean section when appropriate, can help mitigate the risk of injury.\n\nIn conclusion, effective management of maternal health conditions during pregnancy, particularly gestational diabetes, and preparedness for delivery complications are key interventions that could have helped prevent the newborn's brachial plexus injury."}
{"question": "In a 3-year-old child who presents with a convergent squint and requires refraction, what is the best drug to use for cycloplegia?", "gold_answer": "For a 3-year-old child with a convergent squint who requires cycloplegic refraction, cyclopentolate is the best drug to use for cycloplegia. It is effective in overcoming the strong focusing ability in young children and provides an adequate depth of examination for accurate refraction. Additionally, its duration is suitable, typically lasting around 24 hours, which is convenient for both the examination and the recovery process."}

The attending doctor decides to administer nitroglycerine to manage the condition. What is the most suitable route of administration for this medication under these circumstances?", "gold_answer": "In this scenario, given the urgency and critical condition of the patient with acute myocardial infarction and left ventricular failure, the most suitable route of administration for nitroglycerine is intravenous (IV). This method allows for rapid onset of action and precise control over dosing, crucial for managing acute cardiac conditions effectively in an ICU setting. Adjustments to the infusion can be made swiftly based on the patient's response, ensuring optimal therapeutic outcomes."}
{"question": "In a study to measure BP, two students Rakesh and Arif conduct a study on a dog. Rakesh measures BP using a mercury sphygmomanometer on the right femoral artery and Arif measures using a pressure transducer and pulse tracing on the left femoral artery. The mean arterial pressure for both Rakesh and Arif is the same i.e. 100 mmHg. After 5 minutes of injection of adrenaline, Rakesh measures blood pressure 130 mmHg and Arif as 120 mmHg. The difference of 10 mmHg is explained by\nA. Falsely high values at low pressure in pulse tracing\nB. Falsely low values at high pressure in pulse tracings\nC. Femoral artery is more sensitive to adrenaline on right side\nD. Ventricular filling affects diastole period", "gold_answer": "The difference in blood pressure readings between Rakesh and Arif after the injection of adrenaline can be explained by option B: Falsely low values at high pressure in pulse tracings. When using a pressure transducer, it is possible that the measurement may under-report the actual pressure at higher blood pressures, leading to the lower reading recorded by Arif compared to the mercury sphygmomanometer reading by Rakesh."}
{"question": "In a neonatal screening program for detecting congenital hypothyroidism, what is the ideal place and time to collect the blood sample for TSH estimation?", "gold_answer": "The ideal place to collect the blood sample for TSH estimation in a neonatal screening program for detecting congenital hypothyroidism is from the heel of the newborn. The optimal time to perform this test is between 2 to 5 days after birth. This timing accounts for the natural spike in TSH levels that occurs shortly after birth and helps provide accurate and reliable results for early detection and intervention."}
{"question": "Outer layer of the pars tensa called the cutaneous layer is lined by which of the following type of epithelium?\nA. Simple cuboidal epithelium\nB. Ciliated columnar epithelium\nC. Stratified squamous epithelium\nD. Keratinised squamous epithelium", "gold_answer": "The outer layer of the pars tensa, also known as the cutaneous layer, is lined by stratified squamous epithelium. This type of epithelium provides a protective barrier, consistent with its role facing the external ear canal, similar to skin. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Stratified squamous epithelium."}
{"question": "A pregnant woman presents for prenatal care with a history of a severe illness characterized by symptoms including fatigue, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, jaundice, joint pains, and generalized skin lesions that gradually disappeared over three years ago. She is currently asymptomatic. Which laboratory test should be conducted to investigate whether her past illness was related to hepatitis B infection?", "gold_answer": "To determine whether the woman's past illness was related to hepatitis B infection, the appropriate laboratory test to conduct is the hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) test. This test can reveal past exposure to the hepatitis B virus, as the core antibody remains positive after an infection has either resolved or become chronic. Checking the anti-HBc will help identify if her severe illness several years ago was related to a previous hepatitis B infection."}
{"question": "What metabolic process, when activated, can block ionic exchange in the corneal endothelium?", "gold_answer": "When activated, anaerobic glycolysis can block ionic exchange in the corneal endothelium. Under conditions such as hypoxia, where oxygen is limited, cells switch to anaerobic glycolysis to produce ATP. However, this process is less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in a reduced ATP supply. Insufficient ATP affects the function of essential ion pumps like Na+/K+ ATPase, disrupting ionic exchange and potentially compromising corneal clarity."}
{"question": "What feature is not present in the Kuntscher (K) nail used for internal fixation of femoral fractures?", "gold_answer": "The Kuntscher (K) nail, used for internal fixation of femoral fractures, does not include locking screws. This nail is characterized by its straightforward design, typically being a simple metal rod without the additional stabilization provided by locking screws, which are features more commonly found in modern intramedullary nails for enhanced stability and prevention of rotational movement."}
{"question": "Based on the presented clinical scenario of a 51-year-old man who developed a urinary tract infection following surgery for an incarcerated hernia, what preventative measure could have most likely avoided the urinary complications he experienced?", "gold_answer": "To prevent the urinary tract infection in this 51-year-old man following his incarcerated hernia surgery, the most effective measure likely would have been better catheter management. If an indwelling urinary catheter was used, it could have been crucial to limit its use as much as possible, remove it promptly once it was no longer necessary, or consider alternative methods, such as intermittent catheterization, to minimize the risk of infection. Proper hydration, diligent hygiene practices, and ensuring minimal catheter use are key strategies to reduce the chances of postoperative urinary tract infections. By optimizing these factors, particularly the use and management of catheters, the risk of developing this type of complication could be significantly lowered."}
{"question": "What are three characteristics that differentiate a premature baby from a baby with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)?", "gold_answer": "Certainly! Here are three characteristics that differentiate a premature baby from a baby with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR):\n\n1. **Timing of Birth**: A premature baby is born before 37 weeks of gestation. The primary factor here is the early timing of the birth. In contrast, a baby with IUGR can be born at any gestational age, including full-term, but it is smaller due to restricted growth during the pregnancy.\n\n2. **Growth and Development**: Premature babies are small because they haven't had enough time in the womb to grow fully. In contrast, IUGR babies have had inadequate growth due to factors affecting their development in utero, such as placental insufficiency, regardless of the length of the pregnancy.\n\n3. **Associated Health Issues**: Premature babies often face issues related to immaturity of organs, such as breathing problems, temperature regulation, and feeding difficulties, because their systems are not fully developed. Babies with IUGR may face complications related to insufficient nourishment during pregnancy, such as low blood sugar, but do not necessarily have immature organs if they are born full-term. \n\nThese distinctions highlight the different developmental and clinical challenges faced by these two groups of babies."}
{"question": "A 2-year-old boy has been diagnosed with a testicular tumor characterized by the presence of glomeruloid Schiller-Duval bodies. After an orchiectomy, which serum marker should be monitored to check for tumor recurrence in this patient?", "gold_answer": "The serum marker that should be monitored to check for tumor recurrence in this 2-year-old boy diagnosed with a testicular tumor characterized by Schiller-Duval bodies is alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Yolk sac tumors, which are the likely diagnosis given the histological finding, are known to elevate AFP levels. Monitoring AFP after orchiectomy will help in detecting any recurrence of the tumor."}
{"question": "What is the name of the machine used noninvasively to monitor external chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation?", "gold_answer": "The machine used noninvasively to monitor external chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is generally referred to as a CPR feedback device. These devices provide real-time feedback on the depth and rate of chest compressions to ensure their effectiveness. Specific examples of such devices include the 'Q-CPR' from Philips and the 'Zoll PocketCPR,' both of which are known for offering guidance during CPR to improve performance and outcomes."}
{"question": "A 60-year-old man presents with a slowly enlarging painless ulcer on his lower lip that has been present for 3 months. He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, has worked in construction for over 30 years, and is a long-term smoker. On examination, the ulcer is 0.5 x 0.5 cm, nontender, with everted edges, and bleeds upon palpation. What is the most likely diagnosis for this ulcer given these characteristics?", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the ulcer on the lower lip of this 60-year-old man is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The characteristics of the ulcer, such as its slow enlargement, painless nature, everted edges, and tendency to bleed, are classic signs of SCC. His occupational history in construction likely involved significant sun exposure, and his long-term smoking habit are both significant risk factors for SCC, particularly on the lips. These factors, combined with his age, strongly point towards this diagnosis."}
{"question": "What are the factors in a trauma patient that favor fat embolism, specifically including any associations with diabetes mellitus and hypovolemic shock?", "gold_answer": "Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is primarily linked to trauma, particularly fractures of long bones like femur and tibia. When these bones are broken, fat globules from the bone marrow can enter the bloodstream and potentially lead to embolism. However, several other factors can influence the likelihood and severity of fat embolism in trauma patients, including diabetes mellitus and hypovolemic shock.\n\n1. **Diabetes Mellitus**: While diabetes is not directly linked to causing fat embolism, it might have indirect effects that could influence its development. Diabetes can alter metabolism and inflammatory responses, which could, in theory, affect how the body responds to trauma. The chronic inflammation associated with diabetes might not directly increase the likelihood of fat embolism, but it may exacerbate the systemic inflammation if fat embolism does occur, potentially worsening the clinical outcomes.\n\n2. **Hypovolemic Shock**: This condition, characterized by significant blood loss and decreased blood volume, can alter hemodynamic stability and coagulation pathways. The physiological stress response to shock could, in principle, affect the mobilization and circulation of fat globules. Although hypovolemic shock doesn't directly increase the risk of fat embolism, it may exacerbate the situation if fat globules are already in circulation by impairing the body's ability to adequately manage and clear emboli.\n\nAdditional important factors include:\n- **Severity and Nature of Trauma**: High-energy impacts and complex fractures (especially involving the pelvis or multiple fractures) are significant risk factors for FES.\n- **Early Stabilization and Surgical Intervention**: Prompt and proper stabilization of fractures can mitigate the risk, whereas delayed or improper treatment may increase it.\n- **Age and Overall Health of the Patient**: Younger patients tend to have a higher incidence of fat embolism, possibly due to bone marrow characteristics, but those with compromised health may experience more severe consequences if FES develops.\n\nIn conclusion, while diabetes and hypovolemic shock may not inherently cause fat embolism, they can influence the body's response to trauma and potentially exacerbate the effects of fat emboli if they occur. Understanding and managing these conditions appropriately alongside the actual trauma care can be critical in mitigating risks and improving patient outcomes."}
{"question": "A 48-year-old man was found in a stuporous state outside on a cold night with a small cut on his forehead. After a normal non-contrast head CT and 12 hours of monitoring in the emergency department, he experienced headache and auditory hallucinations where the wallpaper threatened his family. He consumes alcohol regularly, has a fine tremor in his right hand, appears distressed, and is diaphoretic, with no abnormalities found in the neurological exam. What is the most likely diagnosis given these symptoms and his history of consuming a pint of vodka before admission?", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for this 48-year-old man is Alcoholic Hallucinosis. Given his regular alcohol consumption and the onset of symptoms shortly after reducing his intake, the auditory hallucinations, tremor, diaphoresis, and overall distress align with this condition. Alcoholic Hallucinosis is characterized by hallucinations following a reduction in alcohol consumption, typically occurring sooner than conditions like delirium tremens. His symptoms, history, and the timeline associated with his alcohol use all support this diagnosis."}
{"question": "A sexually active female presents with green-colored, profuse, frothy, foul-smelling vaginal discharge and intense itching. Upon examination, a strawberry cervix is observed. What is the most likely diagnosis for her condition?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms you're describing—greenish, frothy discharge, foul smell, intense itching, and the presence of a 'strawberry cervix'—are classic indicators of Trichomoniasis. Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, and it aligns well with the clinical features you mentioned. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for her condition is Trichomoniasis."}
{"question": "A person aged 36 years is having firm belief that his wife is having affair. He often sits alone, muttering himself and hears voices commenting about him. He was absolutely normal 2 weeks before.\nMost likely diagnosis is\nA. Schizophrenia\nB. Delusional disorder\nC. Acute psychosis\nD. Somatoform disorder", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is C. Acute psychosis. The rapid onset of symptoms, including delusions about infidelity and auditory hallucinations, aligns with acute psychosis, especially given that the individual was reportedly normal just two weeks prior. Schizophrenia typically involves a longer duration and progression of symptoms, while delusional disorder usually does not include hallucinations like hearing voices. Somatoform disorder is unrelated as it involves physical symptoms without a medical cause, which do not match the current symptoms. Therefore, acute psychosis is the most fitting diagnosis in this scenario."}
{"question": "Cyclosporine inducced HTN is treated by   a)  Clonidine  b) Enalapril   c) Nifedipine   d) Methyl dopa\nA. ad\nB. bc\nC. ac\nD. bd", "gold_answer": "The best treatment options for cyclosporine-induced hypertension from the given choices are enalapril and nifedipine. Enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, is effective but requires careful monitoring due to potential kidney issues. Nifedipine, on the other hand, is a calcium channel blocker that is often preferred as it doesn't pose the same kidney risks when used with cyclosporine. Thus, the correct answer is option B: bc (Enalapril and Nifedipine)."}
{"question": "A 55-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with multiple red, fleshy polypoid masses on the anterior vaginal wall, and a biopsy shows large cells with abundant clear cytoplasm. Considering her history, what is the most significant risk factor for the development of this condition?", "gold_answer": "The most significant risk factor for this 55-year-old woman developing clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina is in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES). DES was a synthetic estrogen prescribed to pregnant women, primarily from the 1940s to the late 1970s, to prevent miscarriages and other pregnancy complications. Studies have shown a strong association between DES exposure in utero and the increased risk of developing vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma later in life. Given the patient's age and the historical use of DES, it is likely that her development of this condition is linked to her prenatal exposure to this drug."}
{"question": "A 54-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis treated with adalimumab presents with lower back pain, night sweats, and significant weight loss over 4 weeks. She has a fever and tenderness over the T10 and L1 vertebrae, as well as pain upon passive extension of the right hip. Which virulence factor is most likely responsible for the infection causing her symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and context suggest that the patient's condition is due to an infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can be more prevalent in individuals using TNF-alpha inhibitors like adalimumab due to their compromised immune system. The bacterium's ability to persist in the host and cause chronic infection is significantly aided by its capacity to evade the immune response. \n\nThe most pertinent virulence factor in this case is the bacteria's surface glycolipids, particularly those involved in preventing the fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes within macrophages. This mechanism allows Mycobacterium tuberculosis to survive and replicate within macrophages, avoiding destruction by the host immune system. These surface glycolipids, therefore, play a crucial role in enabling the bacteria to cause long-term infections such as tuberculosis, which aligns with the patient’s symptoms and presentation."}
{"question": "A 5-month-old infant exhibits progressive head enlargement and a head circumference at the 95th percentile. The anterior fontanelle is tense, and there is downward deviation of the eyes with retracted eyelids. Considering these clinical findings, what imaging study should be performed as the next step in the management to assess the underlying cause of the symptoms?", "gold_answer": "Given the clinical findings of progressive head enlargement, a tense anterior fontanelle, and the characteristic downward deviation of the eyes in a 5-month-old infant, the symptoms highly suggest the possibility of hydrocephalus due to increased intracranial pressure. The most appropriate initial imaging study in this case would be a cranial ultrasound. \n\nCranial ultrasound is ideal for infants with open fontanelles because it is a non-invasive and safe procedure that allows for effective visualization of the ventricles and brain structures without exposure to radiation. This method would allow for the detection of any ventricular enlargement, which can confirm the diagnosis of hydrocephalus. Once confirmed, further detailed imaging (like an MRI) can be considered if needed, but the initial ultrasound is the best step in this scenario."}
{"question": "A 50-year-old female has erythematous skin on her cheek, chin, and forehead, presenting with dilated blood vessels, nodules, and pustules, but notably without any comedones. What is the most likely diagnosis based on these clinical features?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical features described, the most likely diagnosis is rosacea. Rosacea commonly presents with erythema (redness) on the central face, including the cheeks, chin, and forehead, and is often accompanied by telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels). The presence of pustules and nodules, but the absence of comedones, helps distinguish rosacea from acne, which typically features comedones. Given these details, rosacea is the most fitting diagnosis."}
{"question": "A patient with primary Sjogren syndrome has been experiencing parotid swelling for the last 3 months despite treatment with tear replacement for symptomatic relief. She also presents with enlarged posterior cervical lymph nodes, leukopenia, and low C4 complement levels. What is the most likely condition developing in this patient?", "gold_answer": "In a patient with primary Sjogren syndrome, the combination of persistent parotid swelling, enlarged posterior cervical lymph nodes, leukopenia, and low C4 complement levels is highly suggestive of the development of lymphoma. Sjogren syndrome is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The symptoms and laboratory findings in this case align with features seen in such a transformation. Therefore, it is most likely that this patient is developing lymphoma."}

Therefore, this option should be excluded. \n\nGiven these considerations, the correct choice is **C. bcde**, which includes the relevant points about carbogen, the timeframe of hearing loss (both 24 and 72 hours), and the criterion about the audiometric threshold changes, without incorrectly asserting that vertigo is always present."}
{"question": "A one and a half year old child slipped and fell while holding her father's hand and began crying, holding her forearm in a pronated position, refusing to move the affected extremity. Based on these observations, what is the most appropriate immediate management for this condition?", "gold_answer": "Based on the observations provided, the child's symptoms and situation are consistent with a condition known as nursemaid's elbow, or radial head subluxation. This commonly occurs in young children when there's a sudden pull on the arm, leading to the annular ligament slipping over the head of the radius bone.\n\nThe most appropriate immediate management for this condition is to perform a reduction maneuver. This should be done by a healthcare professional trained in the technique, which typically involves:\n\n1. Holding the child’s elbow at 90 degrees.\n2. Applying gentle pressure on the radial head with one hand.\n3. Slowly supinating the child’s forearm (turning the palm upwards) and then flexing the elbow.\n\nThis maneuver often relocates the radial head back into its proper position and should relieve the child’s pain almost instantaneously, allowing them to use their arm normally again. It is important to ensure that this procedure is performed in a safe and controlled manner, ideally by someone experienced with the technique, to avoid additional injury or distress to the child."}
{"question": "A 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and myocardial infarction presents to the emergency room with shortness of breath after waking up in the middle of the night with a choking sensation. On physical examination, you find bibasilar inspiratory crackles and an S3 heart sound. What drug should be administered for rapid, significant relief of this patient's symptoms specifically targeting the Na/K/Cl symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle?", "gold_answer": "In this scenario, the patient is likely experiencing acute heart failure with pulmonary congestion, as suggested by the symptoms and physical examination findings. The most appropriate drug to administer for rapid and significant relief of these symptoms is furosemide. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that acts on the Na/K/Cl symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidneys. It helps to decrease fluid retention by inhibiting sodium and water reabsorption, effectively reducing intravascular volume and alleviating pulmonary congestion."}
{"question": "Given the presented case of a 27-year-old woman with lifelong aches and recent worsening symptoms including bone pain, recent diarrhea, and laboratory results showing severe hypocalcemia with elevated alkaline phosphatase, what condition related to blood transfusion could explain her symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and laboratory findings in this 27-year-old woman, along with the context of blood transfusion, are suggestive of hypoparathyroidism secondary to hemosiderosis or iron overload due to repeated blood transfusions. In patients receiving frequent transfusions, as might occur in chronic conditions like thalassemia, iron can accumulate in tissues, including the parathyroid glands, ultimately impairing their function. This results in hypoparathyroidism, leading to hypocalcemia, which aligns with her severe calcium deficiency. Elevated alkaline phosphatase may indicate increased bone turnover and remodeling in response to low calcium levels. The diarrhea could be a coincidental issue, or it may further exacerbate the calcium imbalance due to malabsorption. If there’s no history suggesting large or rapid transfusions, this chronic complication of iron overload appears to be a plausible explanation for her current symptoms."}
{"question": "A 22-year-old pregnant woman at 12 weeks' gestation presents with abdominal cramping and passing of large vaginal blood clots. On examination, her vital signs are normal, the uterine size is consistent with a 12-week gestation, and a speculum exam reveals an open cervical os with blood clots. A transvaginal ultrasound shows an empty gestational sac, and she is concerned about invasive procedures. What is the most appropriate next step in her management?", "gold_answer": "Given the situation, the most appropriate next step in managing this patient, who is experiencing symptoms suggestive of a miscarriage and is concerned about invasive procedures, is expectant management. This approach respects her preference to avoid interventions like surgery, allowing her body to naturally complete the miscarriage process. Expectant management involves close monitoring for complications such as heavy bleeding or infection and ensuring she has support and guidance on when to seek medical attention. This approach is aligned with her desire to avoid more invasive methods unless absolutely necessary."}
{"question": "A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 10 minutes after falling down a flight of stairs. An x-ray of the right wrist shows a distal radius fracture. A rapidly acting intravenous anesthetic agent is administered, and closed reduction of the fracture is performed. Following the procedure, the patient reports palpitations and says that he experienced an “extremely vivid dream,” in which he felt disconnected from himself and his surroundings while under anesthesia. His pulse is 110/min and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. The patient was most likely administered a drug that predominantly blocks the effects of which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Glutamate\nB. Norepinephrine\nC. Endorphin\nD. Gamma-aminobutyric acid\nE. Dopamine", "gold_answer": "The patient's symptoms following the administration of an anesthetic agent—specifically, vivid dreams, a sense of disconnection from himself, and an increased heart rate and blood pressure—strongly suggest the use of ketamine. Ketamine is known for its dissociative anesthetic properties and can lead to experiences such as vivid dreams and feelings of detachment due to its action on the brain.\n\nKetamine works primarily by blocking NMDA receptors, which are involved in the action of the neurotransmitter glutamate. By inhibiting these receptors, ketamine alters sensory perception and can induce dream-like states, leading to the kinds of experiences described by the patient. Additionally, ketamine can increase sympathetic nervous system activity, which explains the elevated heart rate and blood pressure noted.\n\nTherefore, the drug administered to this patient is most likely one that predominantly blocks the effects of glutamate.\n\n**Answer: A. Glutamate**"}
{"question": "Given a fetus with a crown rump length of 20 cm and a lower limb length of 11 cm, using standard fetal development rules, what is the expected gestational age in months?", "gold_answer": "Given a crown rump length (CRL) of 20 cm and considering standard fetal development patterns, the gestational age is likely around 28 to 32 weeks. This corresponds to roughly 7 months of pregnancy. This estimation considers that CRL measurements are particularly useful in the early and middle stages of pregnancy, and a CRL of 20 cm is typically seen in the late second trimester or moving into the third trimester. Thus, you can expect the gestational age to be about 7 months."}
{"question": "A 70-year-old man with a history of advanced prostate cancer presents with progressively worsening lower back pain, elevated PSA levels, and a technetium-99m bone scan showing increased uptake at the lumbar vertebrae. After confirming tenderness at the lumbar vertebrae and a hard prostate upon examination, what is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's bone metastasis symptoms, in addition to providing analgesia?", "gold_answer": "Given the situation you described—a 70-year-old man with prostate cancer experiencing worsening lower back pain and evidence of bone metastasis at the lumbar vertebrae—the immediate focus should be on alleviating his pain. While analgesics are standard for pain management, considering his condition, external beam radiotherapy to the affected lumbar vertebrae is a highly appropriate and effective option for direct pain relief.\n\nExternal beam radiotherapy can provide significant and often rapid palliative relief by targeting the metastasis directly, reducing tumor burden, and alleviating pressure on the surrounding tissues, which in turn diminishes pain. This approach is highly effective for bone metastases and aligns well as an adjunctive treatment option for managing symptoms related to the cancer spread.\n\nIn addition to radiotherapy for immediate pain control, you might also consider integrating a bone-targeted therapy, such as denosumab or bisphosphonates, as part of the long-term management strategy. These agents can help delay skeletal-related events and slow the progression of bone metastasis, though they do not provide immediate pain relief.\n\nThus, in addressing this patient's immediate need for pain management due to lumbar vertebral metastasis from his prostate cancer, external beam radiotherapy stands out as the most appropriate next step."}

Vancomycin + ceftriaxone", "gold_answer": "The best empirical treatment for a 45-year-old female diagnosed with pneumococcal meningitis is option D: Vancomycin + Ceftriaxone. This combination covers both penicillin-resistant and non-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and effectively penetrates the central nervous system, which is crucial for effectively managing meningitis."}
{"question": "What long-term complication can arise from posterior pituitary dysfunction in a patient with a skull base fracture?", "gold_answer": "A long-term complication that can arise from posterior pituitary dysfunction in a patient with a skull base fracture is diabetes insipidus. This condition is characterized by the lack of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) release, leading to an inability to concentrate urine. As a result, the patient may experience excessive thirst and urination, which can lead to chronic dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypernatremia (elevated sodium levels) if not adequately managed. These complications require careful monitoring and appropriate treatment to prevent adverse health outcomes."}
{"question": "A patient presents with defective adduction of the hip joint along with pain in the hip and knee joints. Which specific nerve is likely involved in causing these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms of defective adduction of the hip joint and pain in the hip and knee joints suggest an issue with the obturator nerve. This nerve innervates the group of adductor muscles responsible for moving the leg inward at the hip joint and can cause pain in both the hip and knee if it is affected. Therefore, the obturator nerve is likely involved in causing these symptoms."}
{"question": "A 5-year-old boy presents with recurrent daytime and nighttime urination issues, an intellectual disability, constant thirst, and moderate growth retardation. Laboratory tests show hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated urine calcium with increased urine osmolality. Considering these symptoms and lab findings, what underlying renal tubular defect is responsible for these clinical manifestations in this child?", "gold_answer": "The clinical manifestations and laboratory findings in this 5-year-old boy suggest the presence of Bartter Syndrome. Bartter Syndrome is characterized by a defect in the renal tubular function, specifically in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This defect involves the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter, leading to hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, polyuria, polydipsia, and hypercalciuria, which aligns well with the elevated urine calcium observed in this patient. The syndrome can also contribute to growth retardation and intellectual disability, as seen in this case. Therefore, the renal tubular defect responsible for these clinical manifestations in the child is consistent with Bartter Syndrome."}
{"question": "In which specific condition during Electric Pulp Testing is it least likely to obtain a false-negative result?", "gold_answer": "During Electric Pulp Testing, obtaining a false-negative result is least likely when there is partial necrosis in the pulp. In cases of partial necrosis, some parts of the pulp may still be alive and responsive to the electric current, potentially leading to a positive response in the test. This partial vitality reduces the likelihood of a false-negative result compared to scenarios where the pulp is entirely necrotic. Hence, conditions involving partial necrosis present a scenario where the test is more likely to yield accurate results reflecting the true vitality of the pulp."}
{"question": "A newborn died shortly after birth and was found to have hepatosplenomegaly and body-wide edema upon examination. Based on these symptoms, what is the most probable diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms of hepatosplenomegaly and total body edema in a newborn who tragically died shortly after birth suggest the condition known as Hydrops Fetalis. Hydrops Fetalis is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of fluid in multiple compartments of the body and often indicates an underlying systemic issue. Given the current context and advancements in medical care that have significantly reduced the occurrence of immune hydrops (primarily due to Rh incompatibility), non-immune hydrops is the more likely cause. Non-immune hydrops can result from various factors including genetic disorders, congenital infections such as Parvovirus B19, or cardiac anomalies. Therefore, based on the symptoms provided, Hydrops Fetalis, likely due to non-immune causes, is the most probable diagnosis."}

This makes smoking the most plausible risk factor among the listed options. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Smoking"}
{"question": "An 11-year-old boy exhibits frequent bullying behavior towards younger classmates, has a history of shoplifting, and regularly stays out late despite his parents' instructions. He is not typically angry or irritable, does not argue with authority figures, and does not exhibit verbal or physical aggression. Given these behavioral patterns, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the behaviors described, the most likely diagnosis for the 11-year-old boy is Conduct Disorder. This diagnosis is fitting because he is engaging in repeated behaviors that violate the rights of others and societal norms, such as bullying, shoplifting, and disregarding authority by staying out late against his parents' wishes. These actions align with the patterns typically associated with Conduct Disorder, which involves more serious rule violations and antisocial behavior beyond typical childhood defiance. While he doesn't show anger or argue with authority figures—a hallmark of Oppositional Defiant Disorder—his behaviors are consistent with Conduct Disorder, given the severity and the impact on others."}
{"question": "In a patient with a 2-week history of abdominal pain, jaundice, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin, and a liver biopsy showing portal fibrosis with scattered schistosome eggs, which type of inflammatory cell is most likely to predominate in the portal tracts of the liver?", "gold_answer": "In a patient with the described symptoms and liver biopsy findings, eosinophils are most likely to predominate in the portal tracts of the liver. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that commonly respond to parasitic infections, such as schistosomiasis, and are known to congregate in areas where schistosome eggs are present, contributing to granulomatous inflammation."}
{"question": "A 44-year-old woman presents with progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion and intermittent palpitations. Physical examination reveals a grade 4/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiates to the back and increases in intensity when her hands are clenched into fists. What finding is most likely to be observed on an echocardiogram of this patient?", "gold_answer": "The most likely finding on an echocardiogram of this patient would be an enlarged left atrium. This dilation occurs due to the regurgitant blood flow back into the left atrium during systole, which is characteristic of mitral regurgitation, suggested by the described murmur and its behavior."}
{"question": "A 10-year-old boy presents with nasal obstruction and intermittent profuse epistaxis. He has a firm pinkish mass in the nasopharynx. All of the following investigations are done in this case except-\nA. X - ray base of skull\nB. Carotid angiography\nC. CT scan\nD. Biopsy", "gold_answer": "In the case of a 10-year-old boy with nasal obstruction, profuse epistaxis, and a firm pinkish mass in the nasopharynx, all of the mentioned investigations might be considered—except for a biopsy. Due to the risk of significant bleeding associated with the vascular nature of conditions like juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, a biopsy is typically avoided. Therefore, the investigation that is not done in this case is: \n\nD. Biopsy"}
{"question": "Which of the following best describes a toe deformity where there is hyperextension at the metatarsophalangeal joint, flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint and flexion at the distal interphalangeal joint?\nA.

{"question": "A patient with a history of mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation presents with an acute onset of weakness in the left upper limb and recovers completely in two weeks. What is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis, given the patient's history and symptoms, is a transient ischemic attack (TIA). The quick onset of the weakness in the left upper limb, coupled with a complete recovery within two weeks, strongly suggests a TIA. This aligns with the patient's background of mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation, which are known risk factors for embolic events, such as TIAs, where clots temporarily disrupt blood flow to the brain without leaving lasting damage."}
{"question": "A 55-year-old man with a history of rheumatic heart disease presents with increasing shortness of breath over a month and examination reveals an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the fifth left intercostal space at the mid-clavicular line, along with chest X-ray findings of left atrial enlargement, straightening of the left cardiac border, and increased vascular markings. Considering these findings, what is the preferred intervention to alleviate his symptoms?", "gold_answer": "Given the findings of rheumatic heart disease, an opening snap, low-pitched diastolic murmur indicative of mitral stenosis, and the associated chest X-ray findings of left atrial enlargement and pulmonary congestion, the preferred intervention for this 55-year-old man is Percutaneous Mitral Balloon Valvotomy (PMBV). This procedure is typically less invasive than surgical options, effectively alleviates symptoms in suitable candidates, and is particularly beneficial in cases of symptomatic severe mitral stenosis as seen in this patient."}
{"question": "A patient is experiencing difficulty swallowing solid foods. Which condition is least likely to be responsible for this symptom?", "gold_answer": "In the context of a patient having difficulty swallowing solid foods, neurological disorders such as a stroke or bulbar palsy are least likely to be responsible for this symptom isolated to solids. These conditions generally affect the swallowing of both liquids and solids, as they disrupt the entire nerve-muscle coordination needed for the swallowing process. Therefore, they typically do not cause problems exclusively with solid foods."}
{"question": "A 12-year-old boy is brought by his father to a pediatrician for evaluation of stiff jaw and swallowing difficulty. He has also developed painful body spasms triggered by loud noise, light, and physical touch. His father says that a few days ago, his son continued to play football, even after falling and bruising his arms and knees. On examination, the boy had a sustained facial smile, stiff arched back, and clamped hands. The toxin responsible for these clinical manifestations that travel retrograde in axons of peripheral motor neurons blocks the release of which of the following?\n \nA. Norepinephrine\nB. Serotonin\nC. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)\nD. Glutamate\nE. Acetylcholine", "gold_answer": "The clinical manifestations described in the 12-year-old boy, such as stiff jaw, swallowing difficulty, painful body spasms triggered by external stimuli, and the “sardonic smile” appearance along with an arched back and clamped hands, are characteristic of tetanus. Tetanus is caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. This toxin, known as tetanospasmin, travels retrograde along the axons of peripheral motor neurons to reach the central nervous system. \n\nOnce in the central nervous system, tetanospasmin blocks the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, specifically gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine. These neurotransmitters are crucial for inhibiting excessive neuronal activity. When their release is blocked, it results in unopposed excitatory signals, leading to the muscle rigidity and spasms observed in tetanus.\n\nTherefore, the toxin responsible for these clinical manifestations blocks the release of:\n\nC. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)"}
{"question": "A 54-year-old woman comes to the clinic for an annual check-up. She has no other complaints except for some weight gain over the past year. Her last menstrual period was 8 months ago. “I started eating less since I get full easily and exercising more but just can’t lose this belly fat,” she complains. She is sexually active with her husband and does not use any contraception since “I am old.” She denies vaginal dryness, hot flashes, fevers, abdominal pain, or abnormal vaginal bleeding but does endorse intermittent constipation for the past year. Physical examination is unremarkable except for some mild abdominal distension with fluid wave. Laboratory findings are as follows:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 138 mEq/L\nCl-: 97 mEq/L\nK+: 3.9 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen: 21 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.4 mg/dL\nGlucose: 120 mg/dL\nB-hCG: negative\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?\nA. Endometriosis\nB. Menopause\nC. Normal aging\nD. Ovarian cancer\nE. Pregnancy", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for this patient is D. Ovarian cancer.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the symptoms and findings presented. The patient is experiencing weight gain despite eating less and exercising more, which suggests an underlying issue. She also reports feeling full easily and has abdominal distension with a fluid wave, indicating ascites. These symptoms, combined with her age and recent menstrual history (8 months without a period potentially indicating perimenopause), align with the common presentation of ovarian cancer. Additionally, ovarian cancer can cause changes in bowel habits, such as constipation, which she is experiencing. Given these factors, ovarian cancer is a plausible and concerning possibility that warrants further investigation."}
{"question": "Give the most probable diagnosis of a 1 yr. old child of normal intelligence with features of hypotonia. On examination there are tongue fasciculations and he keeps his body in a frog like position ?\nA. Guillian Barre Syndrome\nB. Limb girdle atrophy\nC. Down's syndrome\nD. Spinal muscular atrophy", "gold_answer": "The most probable diagnosis for a 1-year-old child displaying hypotonia, tongue fasciculations, and maintaining a frog-like position, while having normal intelligence, is D.

{"question": "A 20-year-old male presented with complaints such as weakness, jaundice, and hematuria, with a history of frequent, self-limiting episodes. He consumed something unusual prior to this episode. Examination revealed mild jaundice and splenomegaly. His lab results showed increased indirect bilirubin, hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, absent haptoglobin, raised LDH, hemosiderinuria, and reticulocytosis. Based on these findings, describe the expected appearance of the peripheral blood smear.", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms, history, and lab findings you've described, the peripheral blood smear in this scenario is likely to show features consistent with hemolytic anemia due to oxidative stress, such as G6PD deficiency. In the blood smear, you would expect to see:\n\n1. **Bite Cells:** These are red blood cells with \"bites\" taken out of them. They result from the spleen removing Heinz bodies, which are aggregates of denatured hemoglobin. This is characteristic of oxidative damage in G6PD deficiency.\n\n2. **Heinz Bodies:** While not visible with a standard stain, special stains like supravital staining can reveal these inclusions inside red blood cells, caused by precipitated hemoglobin due to oxidative stress.\n\nThis pattern arises because the red blood cells are damaged by oxidative agents, which often happens when someone with G6PD deficiency ingests certain substances (like fava beans or specific drugs). The subsequent oxidative damage leads to the appearance of these distinct cell morphologies on a peripheral blood smear."}
{"question": "How many millimeters behind the anterior surface of the cornea is the posterior focal point of the reduced eye situated on the retina?", "gold_answer": "In the reduced eye model, which simplifies the optics of the human eye by assuming a single refractive surface, the posterior focal point is essentially where the image is formed on the retina. This model allows for the straightforward understanding of how light is focused within the eye. The focal length of this model is typically around 22.22 millimeters. Given that the average axial length of the human eye from the anterior surface of the cornea to the retina is approximately 24 millimeters, this suggests that the posterior focal point is located at about 24 millimeters from the corneal surface. Therefore, the posterior focal point of the reduced eye is effectively situated on the retina, typically around 24 millimeters behind the anterior surface of the cornea."}
{"question": "A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency room with symptoms including persistent fever, nausea, vomiting, disorientation, agitation, difficulty breathing, and generalized muscle twitching. His situation worsens when a nasal cannula is attempted, leading to mechanical ventilation. Given these symptoms, what activity or exposure is a known risk factor for his most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "A known risk factor for the man's most likely diagnosis—which, given the symptoms, points toward rabies—is exposure to environments where he could come into contact with potentially rabid animals, notably bats. Activities like spelunking, or cave exploring, could significantly increase the risk of such an exposure, particularly to bats, which are common carriers of rabies. This activity aligns with the neurological and respiratory symptoms exhibited, as rabies can be transmitted through unnoticed encounters such as minor scratches or bites from rabid animals."}
{"question": "A 26-year-old woman, 31 weeks pregnant, presents with a pustular rash that started around her navel and spread to her breasts, back, flexures, and proximal limbs over four weeks. She reports skin pain, fever, and malaise. On examination, the pustules form concentric rings and have coalesced into lakes of pus on the breasts. What is the treatment of choice for her condition?", "gold_answer": "The treatment of choice for this patient's condition, which is consistent with pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (also known as impetigo herpetiformis), is systemic corticosteroids. This choice is made considering their effectiveness in rapidly managing inflammatory symptoms and their relative safety during pregnancy compared to other potential treatments. Systemic corticosteroids can help alleviate the pustular rash, fever, and malaise she is experiencing."}
{"question": "A person laughs to a joke, and then suddenly loses tone of all his muscles. Most probable diagnosis of this condition is?\nA. Cataplexy\nB. Catalepsy\nC. Cathexis\nD. Cachexia", "gold_answer": "The most probable diagnosis for the condition where a person loses all muscle tone suddenly after laughing is cataplexy. Cataplexy is characterized by sudden, temporary episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis triggered by strong emotions, such as laughter, and is often associated with narcolepsy. Therefore, option A, cataplexy, is the correct answer."}
{"question": "A school-going boy experiences episodes of a vacant stare multiple times a day, without any history of fever, seizures, or neurological deterioration. What is the most likely diagnosis for these episodes?", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for these episodes is absence seizures. Absence seizures, also known as petit mal seizures, are characterized by brief episodes of staring or zoning out, during which the child becomes unresponsive. These seizures are common in school-aged children and do not involve the convulsions associated with other types of seizures. Given the boy's age and the frequent, brief nature of these episodes without associated fever or neurological decline, absence seizures align well with the observed symptoms."}
{"question": "Based on a re-analysis of a prospective cohort study that initially found a significant association between smoking and higher rates of esophageal cancer, what could explain the disappearance of this association when considering a confounding factor?", "gold_answer": "The disappearance of the association between smoking and higher rates of esophageal cancer upon re-analysis could be explained by the role of a confounding factor, such as alcohol consumption. Initially, smoking appeared to be linked to increased esophageal cancer risk. However, smoking and alcohol consumption often occur together, and alcohol is a known independent risk factor for esophageal cancer. If the initial analysis did not account for alcohol consumption, it could have attributed the increased cancer risk to smoking when, in fact, alcohol consumption was the true underlying risk factor. By adjusting for alcohol intake in the analysis, it became clear that the observed link between smoking and esophageal cancer was confounded by alcohol, leading to the disappearance of the association. This highlights the importance of considering potential confounding factors in epidemiological studies to accurately identify the true risk factors for diseases."}
{"question": "What is the recommended post-exposure prophylaxis regimen for a healthcare worker who sustained a needle stick injury from a patient with HIV, considering current best practices?", "gold_answer": "In the event of a needle stick injury from a patient with HIV, it is crucial to begin post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as soon as possible, ideally within hours of the exposure, and no later than 72 hours. The recommended PEP regimen consists of three antiretroviral drugs: two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), typically Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and Emtricitabine (FTC), along with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), which can be either Raltegravir or Dolutegravir. This combination should be taken for a duration of 28 days to maximize effectiveness in preventing HIV infection. Always consult the latest guidelines from health organizations such as the CDC for the most current recommendations and consult with a healthcare professional to tailor treatment based on individual circumstances."}
{"question": "A 32-year-old man with a history of HIV and multiple sexual partners presents with painless, skin-colored, and papilliform lesions along the penile shaft and around the anus. Upon application of 5% acetic acid, the lesions turn white. What virus is responsible for the etiology of these lesions?", "gold_answer": "The virus responsible for the etiology of these lesions is the human papillomavirus (HPV). The characteristics you've described—painless, skin-colored, papilliform lesions that turn white upon application of 5% acetic acid—are indicative of genital warts caused by HPV. This is further supported by the patient's history of being HIV positive and having multiple sexual partners, which increases susceptibility to HPV infections."}
{"question": "A 50-year-old Caucasian man is admitted to the ER with intense abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting. His vitals show hypotension and tachycardia, with elevated serum lipase and amylase levels. After stabilization in the ICU, a CT scan reveals a well-circumscribed fluid collection of homogeneous density. Based on these findings, what condition has the patient developed?", "gold_answer": "The patient has developed a pancreatic pseudocyst. This conclusion is based on the combination of his symptoms, vital signs, elevated lipase and amylase levels, and the CT scan findings. Pancreatic pseudocysts are encapsulated fluid collections often associated with acute pancreatitis, appearing as well-circumscribed areas of homogeneous fluid density, just as described in the CT findings."}
{"question": "A 9-weeks pregnant woman has a 2.5 cm mass in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast, but an ultrasound did not show any abnormalities. What is the most appropriate management approach to accurately diagnose the mass?", "gold_answer": "In this situation, given that the woman is 9 weeks pregnant and has a palpable breast mass that was not clearly identified on ultrasound, the most appropriate management approach to accurately diagnose the mass is to perform a core needle biopsy. This procedure is safe during pregnancy and provides a tissue sample that allows for a definitive diagnosis, helping to distinguish between benign and malignant conditions without exposing the mother or the developing fetus to radiation."}
{"question": "What is the recommended distance that the margin of the free end of a stainless steel crown should be positioned relative to the gingiva?", "gold_answer": "The recommended distance that the margin of the free end of a stainless steel crown should be positioned relative to the gingiva is about 0.5 to 1 millimeter below the gum line. This placement helps ensure a good aesthetic appearance and stability, while minimizing the risk of gum irritation and other periodontal issues."}
{"question": "A 37-year-old man arrives at the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident, having suffered significant blood loss and multiple deep lacerations. After suture of the lacerations and administration of 2 liters of saline via large bore intravenous lines, what changes would you expect to observe in this patient's cardiac output and right atrial pressure as a result of this fluid resuscitation?", "gold_answer": "Following the fluid resuscitation with 2 liters of saline in this patient who has suffered significant blood loss, you would expect to observe an increase in both cardiac output and right atrial pressure. The administration of saline increases blood volume, which enhances venous return to the heart. This increase in venous return leads to an elevation in right atrial pressure as more blood returns to the heart. Additionally, according to the Frank-Starling mechanism, the heart will be able to fill more effectively with the increased blood volume, which results in an improved cardiac output as the heart is able to pump more blood with each beat. Therefore, both cardiac output and right atrial pressure should be higher following the fluid resuscitation."}
{"question": "A 27-year-old woman is experiencing purulent discharge, heavy bleeding, and discomfort urinating three days postpartum after a Caesarean section for a breech presentation. She has a fever and her lochia is purulent with blood clots, suggesting a soft and slightly boggy uterus with mild tenderness to manipulation. Considering her clinical presentation, including her past treatment for pyelonephritis and current vital signs, what is the best next step in managing her condition?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical presentation of a 27-year-old woman three days post-C-section with purulent discharge, heavy bleeding, discomfort during urination, fever, and a soft, tender uterus, the most likely diagnosis is postpartum endometritis. This condition typically occurs after cesarean delivery and presents with fever, uterine tenderness, and abnormal lochia, often purulent.\n\nThe best next step in managing her suspected postpartum endometritis is to start her on broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. The standard treatment for this condition involves antibiotics that cover a range of bacteria likely involved in the infection, including both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A common regimen used in this scenario is a combination of clindamycin and gentamicin. Clindamycin provides effective coverage for anaerobic bacteria and some gram-positive organisms, while gentamicin covers gram-negative bacteria.\n\nTherefore, initiating treatment with IV clindamycin and gentamicin is the appropriate management step to address the suspected infection promptly and effectively."}
{"question": "In a village having a population of 1000, we found patients with ceain disease. The results of new diagnostic test on that disease are as follows Test Result Disease Disease Present Absent + 180 400 - 20 400 What is the prevalence of the disease?\nA. 0.2\nB. 2\nC. 18\nD. 20", "gold_answer": "The prevalence of the disease in the village is 20%. Prevalence is calculated by dividing the number of individuals with the disease (200 people, in this case) by the total population (1000 people) and then multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage. This results in a prevalence of 20%, which matches option D."}
{"question": "A 67-year-old woman with advanced bladder cancer is experiencing renal complications, including elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, and proteinuria after undergoing chemotherapy with an agent that forms cross-links between DNA strands. Before starting chemotherapy, her laboratory values were normal. What drug should have been administered alongside hydration to prevent nephrotoxicity in this patient?", "gold_answer": "To prevent nephrotoxicity in a patient receiving cisplatin, a chemotherapy agent known to cause renal complications through its formation of cross-links between DNA strands, the drug most commonly used in addition to hydration is amifostine. Amifostine acts as a cytoprotective agent, helping to mitigate the kidney damage associated with cisplatin treatment by scavenging free radicals and providing protection to the renal tissue. Therefore, alongside saline hydration, administering amifostine would have been the appropriate strategy to prevent nephrotoxicity in this scenario."}
{"question": "In a small child diagnosed with H. influenza meningitis, What investigation must be done before discharging him from the hospital ?\nA. BERA\nB. MBI\nC. CT scan\nD. X-ray skull", "gold_answer": "In the case of a young child diagnosed with H. influenzae meningitis, it is crucial to address and investigate any potential hearing loss before they are discharged from the hospital. Meningitis can lead to complications affecting hearing due to possible damage to the inner ear. To assess whether the child's hearing pathways are intact, a Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA) test should be conducted. BERA evaluates how sound signals are transmitted along the auditory pathways to the brainstem and is particularly effective for young children. Therefore, the investigation that must be done before discharging the child from the hospital is BERA. \n\nAnswer: A. BERA"}
{"question": "A 55-year-old male with atrial fibrillation managed with metoprolol and warfarin has an increased INR of 4.5 after returning from Mexico. He developed a painful red rash on his leg while traveling and was treated by a local physician. What medication likely caused the increased INR?", "gold_answer": "The increased INR of 4.5 in this patient is likely due to an interaction between warfarin and an antibiotic that he was prescribed while in Mexico for his rash. One common antibiotic that is known to cause this kind of interaction is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (often known by the brand name Bactrim). This antibiotic is frequently used to treat skin infections and is notorious for increasing the effects of warfarin, thereby raising the INR. Therefore, it is highly probable that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the medication that caused the increased INR."}
{"question": "Based on the presentation of a 14-year-old boy with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, recurrent respiratory infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a family history of a sibling who died of severe respiratory infection at a young age, what treatment is most likely to improve his gastrointestinal symptoms?", "gold_answer": "Given the presentation, the 14-year-old boy is likely suffering from cystic fibrosis. This condition can lead to pancreatic insufficiency, which causes difficulties in food digestion and absorption due to a lack of necessary digestive enzymes. The resulting malabsorption is likely contributing to his chronic diarrhea and weight loss. To address these gastrointestinal symptoms, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is the most appropriate treatment. This therapy will help him digest and absorb nutrients more effectively, potentially alleviating his digestive issues and aiding in weight maintenance."}
{"question": "A 15-year-old boy has a mass in the distal femur, and an X-ray of the lesion shows features of Codman's triangle and a Sunray appearance. What is the diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The diagnosis is osteosarcoma. The age of the patient, the location of the mass in the distal femur, and the specific X-ray features of Codman's triangle and Sunray (or sunburst) appearance are classic indicators of osteosarcoma, a common malignant bone tumor in teenagers."}
{"question": "A 69-year-old man presents with acute onset aphasia and right-sided weakness for the past 5 hours. His medical history includes hypercholesterolemia and a myocardial infarction 2 months ago. On examination, he has productive aphasia, right-sided facial weakness, and decreased sensation on the right side. Neurological imaging reveals findings suggestive of a large vessel occlusion in the brain. Given these details and considering the time since symptom onset, what is the appropriate course of treatment?", "gold_answer": "The appropriate course of treatment for this 69-year-old man is a mechanical thrombectomy. Since the symptoms have been present for 5 hours and the neurological imaging indicates a large vessel occlusion, mechanical thrombectomy is recommended. This procedure is highly effective for large vessel occlusions, especially within the initial 6-hour window from symptom onset. Although intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is a common stroke treatment, it is generally most effective within 4.5 hours of symptom onset and is not suitable in this case. Therefore, proceeding with a mechanical thrombectomy is the best option given the current circumstances and aligns with established treatment guidelines."}
{"question": "A 66-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient was a restrained passenger in a car that was struck on the passenger side while crossing an intersection. In the emergency department, he is alert and complaining of abdominal pain. He has a history of hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic kidney disease, and perforated appendicitis for which he received an interval appendectomy four years ago. His home medications include rosuvastatin and lansoprazole. His temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 120/87 mmHg, pulse is 96/min, and respirations are 20/min. He has full breath sounds bilaterally. He is tender to palpation over the left 9th rib and the epigastrium. He is moving all four extremities.

{"question": "What external structure found on the bacterial cell wall is involved in bacterial attachment to cell surfaces?", "gold_answer": "Bacterial attachment to cell surfaces is commonly facilitated by structures known as pili and fimbriae. Both these appendages play crucial roles in adhesion. Fimbriae, typically shorter and more numerous, are primarily recognized for their role in adherence to surfaces, including host tissues. However, certain types of pili, particularly type IV pili, also contribute significantly to attachment, often in pathogenic interactions with host cells. Both structures are vital components in the bacteria's ability to adhere to surfaces effectively."}
{"question": "A 70-year-old chronic smoker presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness. The past medical history is insignificant except for hypertension, for which he has been taking medications regularly. The vital signs include: blood pressure 165/110 mm Hg, pulse rate 78/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and temperature 36.1°C (97°F). The neurologic examination shows ⅗ muscle strength in the left upper and lower limbs. An occlusion of a branch of the right middle cerebral artery is suspected because the CT fails to show signs of hemorrhage. The HbA1C is 11%. Which of the following blood lipid components is the most important contributing factor leading to his condition?\nA. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)\nB. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)\nC. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)\nD. High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol", "gold_answer": "The most important contributing factor leading to the patient's condition is B. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). This is because ox-LDL plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, which can lead to ischemic strokes. The patient's uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and smoking increase the risk of atherosclerotic plaque formation and instability due to ox-LDL."}
{"question": "Based on the clinical presentation of a 35-year-old female with paresthesias, weakness of bilateral lower limbs, band-like sensation around the torso, painful loss of vision in both eyes, double vision, and periorbital pain, along with a history of similar past attacks with intermissions of normalcy, what are the oral drugs approved for treating this condition, considering CSF studies indicate mononuclear cell pleocytosis and increased IgG?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and the CSF findings, it's likely that the 35-year-old woman is experiencing symptoms consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is characterized by episodes of neurological symptoms such as numbness, weakness, vision problems, and sensory disturbances, which may remit and relapse over time.\n\nFor treating MS, specifically focusing on oral disease-modifying therapies, there are several options currently approved. These include:\n\n1. **Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera):** This medication helps to reduce the frequency of MS relapses and may slow the progression of disability.\n\n2. **Teriflunomide (Aubagio):** Also an oral medication, it works by inhibiting the function of certain immune cells, thereby reducing inflammatory activity in the nervous system.\n\n3. **Fingolimod (Gilenya):** This drug modifies the immune response by retaining certain immune cells in the lymph nodes, preventing them from causing damage in the central nervous system.\n\nEach of these medications comes with its own profile of potential benefits and side effects, and the choice of treatment often depends on individual patient factors and medical history. It's important to discuss the options with a healthcare professional to determine the most suitable medication for managing the condition effectively."}

{"question": "In which condition would you expect to find elevated levels of ACTH and cortisol in comparison to the levels typically found in a normal individual during the evening?", "gold_answer": "In a normal individual, ACTH and cortisol levels follow a diurnal rhythm, peaking in the morning and declining by evening. If you find elevated levels of both ACTH and cortisol in the evening, it could suggest a condition such as Cushing's disease or ectopic ACTH syndrome. Both conditions are characterized by a disruption in the normal feedback mechanisms that regulate these hormones. In Cushing's disease, the cause is usually a pituitary adenoma that overproduces ACTH, while in ectopic ACTH syndrome, a non-pituitary tumor (often located elsewhere in the body, such as the lungs) produces ACTH. Both scenarios lead to consistently high cortisol levels irrespective of the time of day."}
{"question": "Based on the symptoms of high-grade fever, vomiting, headache, decreased responsiveness, and physical examination findings of maculopapular and ecchymotic rashes, bleeding from venepuncture sites, hepatomegaly, as well as laboratory results showing a high PCV, low platelet count, and mildly prolonged PT, what is the likely diagnosis for this 8-year-old child with left-sided pleural effusion observed in the chest X-ray?", "gold_answer": "Based on the provided symptoms and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis for this 8-year-old child is dengue hemorrhagic fever. This condition is characterized by high fever, bleeding tendencies manifested through rashes and bleeding at venipuncture sites, hepatomegaly, and laboratory results indicating hemoconcentration (high hematocrit) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). The presence of left-sided pleural effusion observed in the chest X-ray further supports this diagnosis, as pleural effusion can occur due to the plasma leakage associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever. The combination of these symptoms and laboratory findings is highly suggestive of this tropical viral illness, especially in endemic areas."}
{"question": "A person involved in a murder is brought to you for determination of age since the defence attorney wants him to be treated as a minor. The results of Xrays are as given below:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) All the epiphyses of the elbow have fused\\r\\n2) All the epiphyses of the shoulder joint have fused\\r\\n3) The epiphyses of the inner end of the clavicles has fused\\r\\n4) The ramus of pubis and ischium has fused \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nWhat is the approximate age of this person assuming that it is a male?\nA. 15 - 17\nB. 18 - 19\nC. 20 years\nD. 21 or more", "gold_answer": "Based on the details provided from the X-rays, it is clear that multiple bone fusions have occurred, which are key indicators of age determination. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. The fusion of the epiphyses of the elbow, which typically occurs around 16 to 17 years of age in males, rules out the possibility of the person being younger than 15.\n\n2. The fusion of the epiphyses at the shoulder joint generally happens between 18 to 20 years of age. This indicates the person is likely older than 17.\n\n3. The fusion of the inner clavicle epiphyses, which usually occurs by 22 to 23 years, is a crucial factor. Its fusion suggests that the person is likely at least 22 years old.\n\n4. Finally, the fusion of the ramus of pubis and ischium, which typically completes between 18 and 21 years, confirms the likelihood of the person being in their late teens or older.\n\nConsidering these points, the presence of both shoulder and clavicle fusions strongly suggests that the person is 21 years of age or older. \n\nTherefore, the approximate age of this person, assuming it is a male, is:\n\nD. 21 or more."}
{"question": "A 20-year-old male presents with an acute onset of pain in the right scrotum. Physical examination reveals a swollen testis with a negative transillumination test. An ultrasound of the scrotum is conducted. Based on these findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the described scenario, the young man's acute onset of pain in the scrotum, combined with the findings from the physical exam showing a swollen testis and a negative transillumination test, raises significant concern for testicular torsion. Testicular torsion is a condition in which the spermatic cord twists, cutting off blood supply to the testicle, and is considered a surgical emergency due to the risk of testicular loss. The acute presentation, characterized by sudden pain with swelling, aligns with the typical clinical presentation of testicular torsion.\n\nIn the evaluation, a Doppler ultrasound would typically be utilized to assess blood flow to the testis. A reduction or absence of blood flow on the ultrasound would support the diagnosis of testicular torsion. Although both testicular torsion and epididymitis can present with swelling, the lack of progressive symptoms such as fever or urinary issues suggests that torsion is more likely in this context, assuming that the ultrasound findings were consistent with decreased perfusion.\n\nIn conclusion, given the acute nature of the symptoms and typical findings in such a case, testicular torsion is the most likely diagnosis. It is imperative for individuals with suspected torsion to receive immediate medical treatment to prevent further complications."}
{"question": "When monitoring a patient with atrial fibrillation on digoxin therapy, if inadequate digoxin dose is suspected, what pharmacokinetic parameter is primarily considered when taking plasma levels 6 hours after the last dose for confirmation?", "gold_answer": "When monitoring a patient with atrial fibrillation on digoxin therapy and an inadequate digoxin dose is suspected, the primary pharmacokinetic parameter to consider when taking plasma levels 6 hours after the last dose is the 'plasma concentration' of digoxin. This measurement, taken outside the initial distribution phase, helps determine whether the drug level falls within the therapeutic range, ensuring the dose is neither too low nor too high, thus guiding effective and safe treatment."}
{"question": "A newborn developed erythematous papular lesions on the face and trunk after being healthy for 2-3 days. The doctor examined the baby and prepared a smear of the pustular lesions. What type of cells would be predominantly seen in the smear prepared from these lesions?", "gold_answer": "In a newborn who develops erythematous papular lesions on the face and trunk, particularly if they are otherwise healthy and the lesions appeared after a couple of days, this is likely indicative of Erythema Toxicum Neonatorum (ETN). When a smear is prepared from the pustular lesions of ETN, it predominantly shows eosinophils. This finding is typical of ETN, which is a benign and self-limiting condition common in newborns."}
{"question": "A 35-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus presents with progressive left flank pain, a fever of 38°C, and painful passive extension of the left hip. Her leukocyte count is elevated at 16,000/mm3. Tenderness is noted upon percussion of the left flank. Based on these clinical findings and the results of an axial CT scan, in which anatomical structure is the underlying pathology most likely located?", "gold_answer": "Based on the provided clinical findings and symptoms, the underlying pathology is most likely located in the psoas muscle. The combination of left flank pain, fever, elevated leukocyte count, painful passive extension of the left hip, and tenderness on percussion of the left flank strongly suggests a psoas abscess. This condition is consistent with the symptoms you described and particularly fits the profile of someone with a history of diabetes, as it can predispose individuals to developing infections like a psoas abscess. The CT scan would likely confirm the diagnosis by visualizing an abscess in the psoas region."}
{"question": "A 76-year-old man with progressive memory loss and disorientation, who was oriented only to self during examination, passed away after four years, and an autopsy is performed. What specific histologic features would confirm the diagnosis that you would expect to find in the brain tissue of this patient?", "gold_answer": "In the brain tissue of a 76-year-old man with a history of progressive memory loss and disorientation consistent with Alzheimer's disease, you would expect to find specific histologic features characteristic of this condition. These include neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein found inside neurons, while amyloid plaques are extracellular deposits primarily composed of beta-amyloid peptide. These pathological features are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and would confirm the diagnosis upon autopsy."}
{"question": "A newborn is exhibiting symptoms of microcephaly, chorioretinitis, limb hypoplasia, and cicatrizing lesions on the hands. What is the most probable diagnosis based on these clinical manifestations?", "gold_answer": "The clinical manifestations of microcephaly, chorioretinitis, limb hypoplasia, and cicatrizing lesions on the hands in a newborn are highly suggestive of congenital varicella syndrome. This condition occurs when a pregnant woman contracts chickenpox, and it can lead to a variety of serious outcomes in the newborn, including the symptoms observed here. Congenital varicella syndrome is characterized by these specific patterns of defects because the varicella-zoster virus can cause damage to the developing fetus, resulting in limb abnormalities, neurological issues like microcephaly, and ocular problems like chorioretinitis, along with distinctive skin scarring."}
{"question": "An 11-year-old boy presents with a pruritic generalized rash, facial edema, cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy, and has been recently started on carbamazepine. Given these findings and the possibility of a drug reaction, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms presented by the 11-year-old boy are highly indicative of a serious drug reaction, specifically DRESS syndrome, which can be triggered by medications such as carbamazepine. Considering the timing of symptom onset with the initiation of carbamazepine, it is crucial to act promptly to prevent further complications. \n\nThe most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to immediately discontinue the use of carbamazepine. Halting the medication is the most vital and immediate action to stop the progression of the reaction. After stopping the drug, further management may be considered, including supportive care and possibly systemic corticosteroids, depending on the severity and involvement of other organ systems. However, the cessation of carbamazepine is the primary and essential first step in addressing the drug reaction."}
{"question": "Given the presentation of a 17-year-old girl with significant weight loss, decreased appetite, increased nervousness, restlessness, a high pulse rate, hypertension, large pupils minimally reactive to light, and a fine tremor, what is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis to consider among her symptoms and lifestyle factors?", "gold_answer": "Given the presentation of symptoms in the 17-year-old girl, it is essential to consider both common and serious conditions that can cause such a clinical picture. The combination of weight loss, nervousness, restlessness, tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis (dilated pupils), and tremor raises concern for conditions involving increased sympathetic nervous system activity.\n\nHyperthyroidism is a common cause in teenagers and should be considered, but the marked autonomic features like dilated pupils and significant hypertension might point towards catecholamine excess conditions such as pheochromocytoma.\n\nAlthough pheochromocytoma is relatively rare, it can lead to severe consequences if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Therefore, it is reasonable to pursue diagnostic tests that can provide more specific information on catecholamine overproduction.\n\nThe most appropriate next step in diagnosis, given these symptoms and the potential severity of pheochromocytoma, is to assess for catecholamine excess. Therefore, ordering plasma free metanephrines or 24-hour urinary metanephrines and catecholamines is recommended to evaluate for pheochromocytoma. These tests will help determine if excess catecholamines might be contributing to her symptoms. Additionally, exploring any potential lifestyle factors or substance use should be kept in mind during history-taking."}
{"question": "A 35-year-old woman with a history of recurrent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) presents with another episode and is admitted for treatment and hypercoagulability workup. Considering the need to rapidly anticoagulate this patient, what is the best initial management approach to start anticoagulation?", "gold_answer": "In the hospital setting, where you need rapid anticoagulation and the flexibility to adjust treatment based on the patient's condition, intravenous (IV) unfractionated heparin is an excellent choice. It provides a quick onset of action, allows for precise monitoring and dose adjustments through the use of aPTT levels, and can be rapidly reversed if necessary, making it particularly suitable for a patient undergoing evaluation and treatment for a hypercoagulable state. Thus, starting with an unfractionated heparin drip is the best initial management approach in this scenario."}
{"question": "A 62-year-old man with a prosthetic aortic valve develops fevers and malaise. His valve was replaced 5 years ago because of aortic stenosis from a bicuspid valve. He has a systolic ejection murmur but no other abnormalities on examination. Blood cultures are most likely to grow which of the following?\nA. fungi\nB. bartonella\nC. diphtheroid\nD. Staphylococcus epidermidis", "gold_answer": "The scenario you’ve described involves a patient with a prosthetic aortic valve who developed symptoms suggestive of an infectious process, notably fevers and malaise. Given that the valve was replaced 5 years ago, the timing points towards late-onset prosthetic valve endocarditis. \n\nIn such cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis, are the most common culprits. These bacteria are known for their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces like prosthetic valves and often present with insidious symptoms. Other organisms such as fungi, Bartonella, or diphtheroids are possible but less commonly implicated in this scenario without additional risk factors or history.\n\nTherefore, based on the information and typical patterns of infection associated with prosthetic heart valves, blood cultures in this case are most likely to grow Staphylococcus epidermidis.\n\n**Answer: D. Staphylococcus epidermidis**"}
{"question": "A 24-year-old woman at 6 weeks gestation presents with a clear, sticky discharge from her right nipple with pink staining on her bra for the past week, without any associated breast pain, skin changes, or palpable masses. She is on fluoxetine for major depressive disorder and has no family history of breast or gynecological cancers. Upon examination, the discharge is confirmed to be pink and sticky, with no abnormalities in the axillary lymph nodes or other breast issues. Considering these clinical findings, what is the most likely diagnosis for this patient's nipple discharge?", "gold_answer": "Given the clinical findings you've described, the most likely diagnosis for the patient's nipple discharge is an intraductal papilloma. This is a benign condition often resulting in nipple discharge that can be clear or bloody due to the presence of a small, non-cancerous growth in the milk duct. Her age, the nature of the discharge, and absence of other concerning symptoms like lumps or skin changes, support this diagnosis. While hormonal changes during pregnancy and medication effects are also considerations, they typically result in different types of discharge. Therefore, an intraductal papilloma fits the clinical picture best."}
{"question": "What is one assessment factor that is not included in Kocher's criteria for diagnosing septic arthritis of the hip?", "gold_answer": "One assessment factor that is not included in Kocher's criteria for diagnosing septic arthritis of the hip is the C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Kocher's criteria focus on four main factors: the inability to bear weight on the affected leg, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 40 mm/h, a fever higher than 38.5°C (101.3°F), and a white blood cell count exceeding 12,000 cells per mm³. While CRP is commonly used in diagnosing various inflammatory conditions, it is not part of the original Kocher's criteria for septic arthritis of the hip."}
{"question": "Which bone is commonly fractured in the X-ray given below that when a person falls on outstretched hands ?\nA. Distal radius bone\nB. ulnar styloid\nC. scaphoid\nD. lunate bone", "gold_answer": "A. Distal radius bone\n\nWhen a person falls on their outstretched hands, the distal radius is the bone that is most commonly fractured. This type of injury is often referred to as a Colles' fracture. While it's possible for other bones such as the scaphoid or the ulnar styloid to also be injured in such falls, the distal radius is statistically the most frequently affected."}
{"question": "A 30-year-old woman presents with symptoms including irregular and heavy periods, fatigue, joint pain, constipation, thinning eyebrows, and recent weight gain. Her lab results show elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone, low total T4, and positive thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Based on these findings, what condition is she at increased risk for developing in the future?", "gold_answer": "Based on her symptoms and lab results, the woman appears to have Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition that often leads to hypothyroidism. Over time, individuals with Hashimoto's are at increased risk for several other conditions. Of particular concern in her case, due to the chronic inflammation associated with Hashimoto's, is the potential development of thyroid lymphoma. Although rare, the persistent autoimmune activity in the thyroid can, in some cases, lead to this serious condition. Regular monitoring and consultation with her healthcare provider are advisable to manage her current thyroid condition and watch for any future complications."}
{"question": "An asymptomatic 15-year-old high school wrestler with no family history of renal disease has a urine dipstick examination that tests positive for protein during his preseason physical exam. What is the next appropriate step in the clinical management of this patient?", "gold_answer": "In managing an asymptomatic 15-year-old high school wrestler who presents with proteinuria on a urine dipstick test, the next appropriate step is to determine if the proteinuria is transient or persistent. Given his age and activity level, it's important to consider that physical exertion or dehydration might have caused temporary proteinuria. \n\nTo start, it’s prudent to repeat the urine dipstick test after ensuring he's at rest and properly hydrated. If the repeat test still shows proteinuria, or if there are concerns about orthostatic proteinuria, collecting a first morning urine sample would be a logical next step. This approach helps to rule out orthostatic proteinuria by seeing if protein is present after a period of lying down overnight. If the morning sample is negative for protein, it suggests orthostatic proteinuria, which is generally benign.\n\nTherefore, repeating the urinalysis after rest and proper hydration is a sensible initial approach to differentiate transient causes from more concerning persistent proteinuria. Based on these results, further evaluation can be guided."}
{"question": "A man with an upper abdominal injury shows symptoms of right upper quadrant and back pain along with bloody vomitus. An abdominal X-ray reveals retroperitoneal pneumatosis. Based on these findings, which specific injury should be suspected?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms described—right upper quadrant and back pain, bloody vomitus, and the X-ray finding of retroperitoneal pneumatosis—the specific injury that should be suspected is a perforated duodenum. The presence of air in the retroperitoneal space, or retroperitoneal pneumatosis, strongly suggests a perforation in the gastrointestinal tract, with the duodenum being a likely suspect due to its retroperitoneal location. The combination of these symptoms and findings aligns with a duodenal perforation as the probable issue."}
{"question": "A 14-year-old boy with sickle cell disease presents with fatigue, occasional palpitations, shortness of breath, fever, and pale conjunctivae. His lab results show severe anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.4 g/dl and a reticulocyte count of 0.1%. What is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and lab findings in this 14-year-old boy with sickle cell disease strongly suggest an aplastic crisis. This condition is characterized by a sudden drop in hemoglobin levels due to the suppression of red blood cell production by the bone marrow, leading to a very low reticulocyte count. In individuals with sickle cell disease, one common cause of aplastic crisis is an infection with parvovirus B19. This virus specifically targets and infects erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, which temporarily halts the production of red blood cells. Given the boy's fever and the acute drop in hemoglobin accompanied by a low reticulocyte count, a parvovirus B19 infection is the most likely underlying cause of his current condition."}
{"question": "What condition is characterized by a young adult presenting with decreased vision in both eyes after a viral illness, mild decrease in visual acuity, paracentral scotomas, and wedge-shaped parafoveal retinal lesions observed on fundus examination?", "gold_answer": "The condition characterized by a young adult presenting with decreased vision in both eyes after a viral illness, mild decrease in visual acuity, paracentral scotomas, and wedge-shaped parafoveal retinal lesions observed on fundus examination is Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy (AMN). AMN is known for these distinct wedge-shaped lesions and can occur following a viral illness, making it a fitting diagnosis given the described symptoms and circumstances."}
{"question": "A 1-month-old infant is experiencing repeated bilious vomiting and is found to have a marked narrowing of the midportion of the duodenum upon an upper GI series. Considering these symptoms and findings, what is the most likely anatomical abnormality causing this gastrointestinal obstruction?", "gold_answer": "The most likely anatomical abnormality causing the gastrointestinal obstruction in this 1-month-old infant, given the symptoms of repeated bilious vomiting and the marked narrowing of the midportion of the duodenum observed in an upper GI series, is an annular pancreas. An annular pancreas can encircle the duodenum and cause precisely the kind of narrowing described, leading to obstruction and the associated symptoms. This congenital condition aligns well with the observations and the clinical presentation in this case."}
{"question": "In a patient with elevated plasma cortisol levels where dexamethasone fails to suppress cortisol secretion, what is the next diagnostic test to perform to further evaluate the cause of hypercortisolism?", "gold_answer": "In a patient with elevated plasma cortisol levels where dexamethasone fails to suppress cortisol secretion, the next diagnostic test to perform is measuring the plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. This test will help differentiate whether the cortisol excess is due to ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent causes. If the ACTH level is elevated, it suggests an ACTH-dependent cause, such as ectopic ACTH syndrome or Cushing's disease (pituitary adenoma, though typically sensitive to dexamethasone). If the ACTH level is low, it indicates an ACTH-independent cause, usually pointing to an adrenal source, such as an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma. Measuring ACTH is crucial in directing further diagnostic steps and management."}
{"question": "What are the primary causes of anemia in chronic renal failure?", "gold_answer": "Anemia in chronic renal failure is primarily caused by several interrelated factors:\n\n1. **Erythropoietin Deficiency**: The kidneys produce erythropoietin, a hormone crucial for the production of red blood cells. In chronic renal failure, damaged kidneys significantly reduce erythropoietin production, leading to decreased red blood cell production and anemia.\n\n2. **Iron Deficiency**: Patients often have insufficient iron due to dietary restrictions, blood loss during dialysis, and impaired absorption. Iron is vital for hemoglobin production, and its deficiency can exacerbate anemia.\n\n3. **Inflammation**: Chronic inflammation can cause the body to retain iron in cells like macrophages, reducing its availability for hemoglobin synthesis. This condition, known as functional iron deficiency, contributes further to anemia.\n\n4. **Reduced Red Blood Cell Lifespan**: Accumulation of toxins due to impaired kidney function can shorten the lifespan of red blood cells, creating a need for increased production, which is difficult under the circumstances.\n\n5. **Blood Loss**: Frequent blood sampling and the dialysis process itself can lead to cumulative blood loss over time, further contributing to anemia.\n\nAll these factors collectively disturb the normal balance of red blood cell production and destruction, leading to the common occurrence of anemia in patients with chronic renal failure."}
{"question": "What test in DNA technology uses oligomers with a single base pair substitution to analyze genetic variations?", "gold_answer": "The test in DNA technology that uses oligomers with a single base pair substitution to analyze genetic variations is known as the Allele-Specific Oligonucleotide (ASO) assay. This method utilizes short, labeled DNA probes that are designed to hybridize specifically to sequences with known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The probes will only bind if the target DNA contains a perfectly complementary sequence, allowing for precise detection of specific genetic variations."}
{"question": "A 17-year-old girl exhibits progressively worsening ataxia, frequent falls, nystagmus, and absent deep tendon reflexes starting from the age of 9, with an onset of clumsiness. Given these symptoms and the presumption of an inherited condition, what is the most likely genetic pathophysiology responsible for this disorder?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms described, including progressively worsening ataxia, frequent falls, nystagmus, and absent deep tendon reflexes starting from childhood, strongly suggest Friedreich's ataxia. This condition is a hereditary degenerative disease of the nervous system.\n\nThe genetic pathophysiology responsible for Friedreich's ataxia involves a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FXN gene. Specifically, there are an excessive number of GAA repeats in the first intron of the FXN gene, which leads to the reduced production of frataxin, a crucial mitochondrial protein. The deficiency of frataxin results in the degeneration of nerve and muscle cells, leading to the symptoms observed in the patient. This mechanism aligns well with the symptoms and onset age of the patient's condition."}
{"question": "What antibiotic should not be used in the treatment of a 16-month-old boy with meningitis caused by an organism that grows on chocolate agar but not blood agar and hasn't received any vaccinations?", "gold_answer": "Fluoroquinolones should not be used in the treatment of a 16-month-old boy with meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, which is the organism that grows on chocolate agar but not on blood agar. These antibiotics are generally avoided in young children due to safety concerns and potential side effects on their developing systems. Additionally, they are not typically recommended for treating bacterial meningitis in this age group."}
{"question": "In a triple arthrodesis procedure for correcting hindfoot deformity, which bones are fused?", "gold_answer": "In a triple arthrodesis procedure, the bones that are fused are the talus, calcaneus, navicular, and cuboid. The procedure specifically fuses three joints: the subtalar joint (between the talus and calcaneus), the talonavicular joint (between the talus and navicular), and the calcaneocuboid joint (between the calcaneus and cuboid). This fusion aims to provide increased stability and pain relief in cases of foot deformities or arthritis."}
{"question": "A 55-year-old male patient underwent cholecystectomy for gallstone calculus and exhibited symptoms of irregularly irregular pulse at 160/min, blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg, and a temperature of 40°C during surgery. Additionally, there was a swelling in the neck observed. What is the most likely diagnosis given these clinical findings?", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for this patient is a thyroid storm. The symptoms you've described—including the irregularly irregular pulse and rapid heart rate, extremely low blood pressure, high fever, and neck swelling—are classic indications of this acute, life-threatening condition. Thyroid storm is often triggered by stressors such as surgery, especially in patients with undiagnosed or untreated hyperthyroidism. The presence of neck swelling could further suggest a thyroid-related issue, such as an enlarged thyroid."}
{"question": "Identify which of the following segments is not part of the branches of the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery.", "gold_answer": "The ophthalmic artery is not a branch of the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery."}
{"question": "What combination of surgical flaps is recommended for reconstructing a full thickness loss of the middle one third of the upper lip?", "gold_answer": "For reconstructing a full-thickness loss of the middle one-third of the upper lip, a combination of the Abbe flap and potentially another technique such as the Karapandzic flap could be recommended, depending on the size and complexity of the defect. The Abbe flap is particularly suitable for central lip defects, as it provides excellent aesthetic and functional results by bringing in similar tissue from the opposite lip. This approach maintains symmetry and matches the color, texture, and thickness of the native lip.\n\nIf the defect is larger or more complex, incorporating the Karapandzic flap can be beneficial. This technique involves mobilizing local tissue, which can help provide additional coverage and functionality. This combination ensures a balance between maintaining a natural appearance and preserving crucial lip movements, such as those necessary for expressions and oral functions. Such a strategy allows for versatile reconstruction tailored to the specific needs of the defect, achieving optimal aesthetic and functional outcomes."}
{"question": "A 52-year-old man with a history of HIV and inconsistent medication adherence presents with headaches, vertigo, personality changes, ataxia, and apathy. His Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30, and MRI shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion in the brain measuring 4.5 cm. Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Given these findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for this 52-year-old man, given his history of HIV, inconsistent medication adherence, the neurological symptoms, cognitive impairment, and imaging findings is primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. The presence of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion on MRI combined with the detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid strongly suggests primary CNS lymphoma, particularly in an immunocompromised individual such as someone with poorly controlled HIV. Other conditions like cerebral toxoplasmosis are common in such patients but typically present with multiple lesions, and the detection of EBV DNA aligns more specifically with primary CNS lymphoma."}
{"question": "In a 36-year-old pregnant woman, an ultrasound reveals small grape-like cystic structures without evidence of a developing embryo, leading to a diagnosis of a complete molar pregnancy. What is the genotype of the mole, and what is the origin of its genetic material?", "gold_answer": "In a complete molar pregnancy, the ultrasound findings of small grape-like cystic structures without a developing embryo are indicative of abnormal trophoblastic growth. The genotype of a complete mole is typically 46,XX or, less commonly, 46,XY. In either case, all of the genetic material originates from the father. This occurs when an 'empty' egg lacking maternal DNA is fertilized by one sperm that duplicates itself (leading to 46,XX) or by two sperm (leading to 46,XY). The more common scenario is the 46,XX genotype, resulting from a single sperm duplicating its genetic material in the absence of maternal contribution."}
{"question": "A 40-year-old female with severe mitral stenosis and a left atrial appendage clot presents with dyspnoea on exertion and atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate. What is the treatment option that should be avoided in her current condition?", "gold_answer": "In this patient's case, due to the presence of a left atrial appendage clot and severe mitral stenosis, the treatment option that should be avoided is cardioversion. Whether electrical or pharmacological, cardioversion could dislodge the clot, significantly increasing the risk of a thromboembolic event, such as a stroke. Therefore, the focus should remain on rate control with medications like beta-blockers rather than rhythm control through cardioversion."}
{"question": "A 20-year-old patient is brought to the emergency room with respiratory distress and hypotension. On examination, there is subcutaneous emphysema and no air entry on the right side. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?", "gold_answer": "In this scenario, the presentation suggests a tension pneumothorax, particularly given the respiratory distress, hypotension, subcutaneous emphysema, and absent air entry on the right side. The next best step in management is to relieve the pressure buildup in the pleural space immediately, as this is a life-threatening condition. Therefore, performing a needle decompression (needle thoracostomy) on the affected side, which is the right side in this case, is the immediate intervention required. This will release the trapped air and alleviate the pressure on the lung and mediastinum, stabilizing the patient's condition and improving cardiac function. Following needle decompression, further definitive management with chest tube insertion would be indicated to re-expand the lung and prevent recurrence."}
{"question": "A 16-year-old girl has not yet experienced menarche, displays short stature at the 33rd percentile, and has a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, along with excessive skin on the neck. Considering these symptoms, what is the most likely genetic abnormality responsible for her condition?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms you've described—delayed menarche, short stature, a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, and possibly a webbed neck—are classic indicators of Turner Syndrome. Turner Syndrome is a chromosomal condition that affects females, and it occurs when one of the X chromosomes is missing or partially missing. The most common genetic abnormality linked to Turner Syndrome is the loss of one X chromosome, often represented as 45, X. This genetic abnormality is responsible for the features and symptoms observed in the girl."}
{"question": "In the case of a patient who presents with a laceration and swelling of the inguinal region following a road-traffic accident, where distal pulsation is felt, and examination reveals a transected common femoral vein while the internal iliac artery, common iliac artery, and external femoral artery are intact, what is the treatment of choice?", "gold_answer": "In the scenario described, the treatment of choice for a transected common femoral vein, especially considering the major role this vein plays in venous return from the leg, is to perform a venous repair. This typically involves directly suturing the vein, known as venorrhaphy, or employing a graft if necessary to bridge any significant gap. Repairing the vein is crucial to prevent complications such as venous hypertension, swelling, and chronic venous insufficiency, ensuring long-term vascular health and function in the affected limb."}
{"question": "An 80-year-old woman with a history of chronic constipation and postprandial abdominal pain presents with acute severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and hypotension after a recent percutaneous intervention for an inferior wall STEMI. Despite treatment, she dies, and autopsy reveals a dark hemorrhagic appearance of the sigmoid colon. What pathology is most likely associated with her cause of death?", "gold_answer": "The pathology most likely associated with her cause of death is ischemic colitis. The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea in the context of recent cardiac intervention, coupled with hypotension, suggests a significant compromise in blood flow to the colon. The dark, hemorrhagic appearance of the sigmoid colon observed at autopsy is characteristic of ischemic colitis, which often occurs in the setting of reduced blood supply. This condition can be triggered by factors such as hypotension or embolic events, particularly in an elderly patient with a history of cardiovascular issues."}
{"question": "How many grams of bleaching powder are required to disinfect 455 litres of water if 4, 5, and 6 cups show distinct colouration in Horrock’s apparatus?", "gold_answer": "To disinfect 455 liters of water, 2.73 grams of bleaching powder are required. This is based on the observation that cups 4, 5, and 6 show distinct coloration in Horrock’s apparatus, indicating a requirement of 6 mg/L. Calculating for the total volume: 6 mg/L x 455 L equals 2730 milligrams, which converts to 2.73 grams."}
{"question": "A 14-year-old male presents with altered mental status and severe metabolic acidosis. After being intubated and placed on a ventilator with volume control assist-control settings, an arterial blood gas is obtained showing a pH of 7.05, pCO2 of 40 mmHg, indicating uncompensated metabolic acidosis. Given these findings and the current ventilator settings of a respiratory rate of 14/min and tidal volume of 350 mL, with standard PEEP and FiO2 levels, what is the best next adjustment to the ventilator settings to better address his acid-base status?", "gold_answer": "To address the severe metabolic acidosis reflected in the arterial blood gas results, the best next step is to increase the respiratory rate on the ventilator. This action helps enhance the minute ventilation, allowing for more effective removal of carbon dioxide and aiding in compensating for the acidosis. Given the current settings and the critical need to lower the pCO2 to correct the pH, adjusting the respiratory rate is a prudent initial intervention. Increasing the rate will lead to more frequent breaths per minute, facilitating the removal of CO2 without the increased risk to lung integrity that might accompany raising the tidal volume, especially in a pediatric patient. Therefore, increasing the respiratory rate is the most appropriate adjustment at this time."}
{"question": "A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital with a painful right foot, and a CT scan reveals a thrombotic occlusion of the femoral artery in the proximal part of the adductor canal. Which artery is most likely to maintain blood supply to the leg through the genicular anastomosis?", "gold_answer": "The artery most likely to maintain blood supply to the leg through the genicular anastomosis in the case of a thrombotic occlusion of the femoral artery in the proximal part of the adductor canal is the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery. This artery, arising from the deep artery of the thigh, supplies collateral circulation to bypass the blockage and maintain blood flow to the leg."}
{"question": "Considering the 58-year-old patient's complete medical history, current health status, and laboratory findings, what are the potential contraindications for organ donation, and is there an absolute contraindication that would prevent him from donating organs or tissues?", "gold_answer": "When evaluating a 58-year-old patient for organ donation, several potential contraindications need to be considered, based on his medical history, current health status, and laboratory findings. Absolute contraindications typically include:\n\n1. **Active Infection**: If the patient has a systemic infection, particularly with transmissible agents, it's a red flag, as these can transfer to the donor recipient.\n\n2. **Malignancy**: Cancers that have metastasized (spread to other parts of the body) usually contraindicate organ donation due to the risk of transferring cancerous cells.\n\n3. **Untreated HIV**: Although treatment advancements allow some individuals with HIV to donate organs, untreated HIV remains a significant barrier.\n\n4. **Severe Hepatitis**: Untreated or active hepatitis, especially Hepatitis B and C, can affect organ viability and be transmitted.\n\n5. **Prion Diseases**: Diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease pose significant risks due to their infectious nature and lack of treatment.\n\nAdditionally, severe organ dysfunction or failure and certain neurological disorders can also disqualify someone from donating. It's also important to consider recent laboratory findings for potential infections or organ dysfunction, and any undisclosed lifestyle-related risks that could introduce unforeseen complications.\n\nGiven these considerations, absolute contraindications primarily focus on systemic infections, untreated serious viral diseases, active widespread malignancies, and prion diseases. If one or more of these are present in the patient, they would prevent him from donating organs or tissues."}
{"question": "A 25-year-old bodybuilder who has been using anabolic steroids presents with symptoms of puffy feet for the last 2 months, and he died suddenly during a workout. A post-mortem heart biopsy was conducted. Based on this scenario and symptomatology, what is the diagnosis indicated by the biopsy findings?", "gold_answer": "Based on the scenario described, the biopsy findings in the 25-year-old bodybuilder who had been using anabolic steroids likely indicate steroid-induced cardiomyopathy. This condition is characterized by hypertrophy (thickening) of the heart walls, particularly the left ventricle, often coupled with fibrosis (scar tissue formation) within the heart muscle. The thickened heart muscle and fibrosis can disrupt the heart's electrical signals, increasing the risk of arrhythmias, which can lead to sudden cardiac death, especially under physical exertion. In this case, the puffy feet suggest fluid retention, a common symptom of heart failure due to compromised cardiac function. The combination of these findings and the sudden death aligns with the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy induced by anabolic steroid use."}
{"question": "A 75-year-old male is brought to the emergency room by his daughter due to slurred speech and a drooping eyelid on the right side. This morning, he had difficulty eating his breakfast and immediately called his daughter for help. She says that his voice also seems different. His temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 120/78 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 21/min, and pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. On physical exam, he is oriented to time and place. There is right-sided nystagmus and he has difficulty with point-to-point movement. Where is the lesion responsible for his symptoms most likely located?\nA. Anterior spinal artery\nB. Posterior inferior cerebellar artery\nC. Anterior cerebral artery\nD. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery\nE. Basilar artery", "gold_answer": "The lesion responsible for the symptoms is most likely located in the territory of the Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). The symptoms, which include slurred speech, a droopy eyelid on the right side, difficulty eating, voice changes, right-sided nystagmus, and difficulty with coordinating movements, align with what is seen in Wallenberg syndrome, also known as lateral medullary syndrome. These manifestations are classically due to a PICA stroke, which affects the lateral medulla and features both cranial nerve and cerebellar pathway involvement. Therefore, option B, Posterior inferior cerebellar artery, is the correct answer."}
{"question": "A 15-year-old boy comes to the physician because of severe muscle cramps and pain for 3 months. He first noticed these symptoms while attending tryouts for the high school football team. Since then, he becomes easily fatigued and has severe muscle pain and swelling after 10 minutes of playing. However, after a brief period of rest, the symptoms improve, and he is able to return to the game. Two days ago, he had an episode of reddish-brown urine after playing football. There is no family history of serious illness. He appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. Serum creatine kinase concentration is 333 U/L. Urinalysis shows:\nBlood 2+\nProtein negative\nGlucose negative\nRBC negative\nWBC 1–2/hpf\nWhich of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\"\nA. Thyroid hormone deficiency\nB. Myophosphorylase deficiency\nC. Acid maltase deficiency\nD. CTG repeat in the DMPK gene", "gold_answer": "The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is **B. Myophosphorylase deficiency**. This condition, also known as McArdle disease, is consistent with the exercise intolerance, muscle cramps, and myoglobinuria (reddish-brown urine) described in the scenario. These symptoms occur because of the inability of the muscle cells to properly break down glycogen during physical activity, leading to the characteristic \"second wind\" phenomenon where symptoms improve after a brief rest. The elevated creatine kinase level and presence of myoglobin in the urine further support this diagnosis. McArdle disease fits the clinical picture presented in this case."}
{"question": "What is the primary risk that healthcare providers aim to prevent by avoiding the transfer of cord blood to the fetus before clamping the umbilical cord?", "gold_answer": "Healthcare providers aim to prevent neonatal polycythemia, which is a condition characterized by an excessively high concentration of red blood cells in the newborn's circulation. This can lead to increased blood viscosity, respiratory difficulties, and jaundice shortly after birth. By managing the timing of cord clamping, providers strive to balance the benefits of additional blood volume and iron transfer to the newborn while mitigating the risks associated with having too much blood. Additionally, they consider maternal health, particularly avoiding alloimmunization in Rh-negative mothers, to prevent complications in future pregnancies."}
{"question": "A 5-year-old boy presents with symptoms of sore throat, headache, fever, difficulty eating, cervical lymphadenopathy, and erythematous tonsils with exudates. A streptococcal rapid antigen detection test returns negative. Based on these clinical features, what is the most likely causative agent of his condition?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical features presented for the 5-year-old boy, the most likely causative agent of his condition—given the sore throat, headache, fever, swollen neck glands, and tonsillar exudates with a negative rapid strep test—is adenovirus. Adenovirus is a common viral cause of pharyngitis in children that can present with these symptoms, often resembling streptococcal pharyngitis. While Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) could also be considered, the absence of symptoms typically associated with EBV infection, such as significant fatigue and splenomegaly, makes adenovirus a more likely cause in this scenario."}
{"question": "A patient presents with bleeding from the ear, pain tinnitus and progressive deafness. On examination, there is a red swelling behind the intact tympanic membrane which blanches on pressure with pneumatic speculum. Management includes all except:\nA. Radiotherapy\nB. Surgery\nC. Interferons\nD. Pre-operative embolisation", "gold_answer": "The management of a patient with symptoms and examination findings suggestive of a glomus tumor, such as bleeding from the ear, tinnitus, progressive deafness, and a red swelling behind the tympanic membrane that blanches on pressure, typically includes several options. Surgical removal of the tumor is often considered when feasible. Pre-operative embolization may be employed to reduce the blood supply to the tumor and minimize bleeding during surgery. Radiotherapy might be used as an alternative treatment if surgery is not possible or as adjunctive therapy.\n\nHowever, interferons are not typically part of the management strategy for glomus tumors. These are more commonly used for other types of tumors or certain immune-related disorders and are not standard treatment for this condition.\n\nTherefore, in this context, management includes all except:\n\nC. Interferons"}
{"question": "A 10-year-old girl presented to the emergency room after ingesting 10 crushed seeds and is showing specific ECG changes. Based on this presentation, which plant's seeds are the most likely cause?", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided, the seeds from Yellow Oleander (Thevetia peruviana) are the most likely cause of the girl's ECG changes. Yellow Oleander seeds are highly toxic and contain cardiac glycosides, which can lead to significant cardiac issues, including arrhythmias, when ingested even in small amounts. The ingestion of 10 crushed seeds aligns with the severe cardiotoxic effects you are describing. Therefore, it is highly plausible that the ECG changes are due to the toxicity of Yellow Oleander seeds."}
{"question": "A 57-year-old man presents with flank pain, hematuria, malaise, myalgia, and a generalized itchy rash. He has a history of gastroesophageal reflux, improved with pantoprazole. Lab tests show elevated creatinine but normal renal ultrasound. Given these symptoms and findings, what is the most likely finding in this patient's urine analysis?", "gold_answer": "Given the symptoms and findings in this case, the most likely finding in this patient's urine analysis would be the presence of eosinophils. The combination of flank pain, hematuria, malaise, myalgia, a generalized itchy rash, and the history of pantoprazole use suggests drug-induced interstitial nephritis, a condition where eosinophils can commonly be found in the urine due to the underlying hypersensitivity reaction."}
{"question": "Given a patient who presents with fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, and a high leukocyte count of 66,500/mm^3 with a normal differential and elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the presented symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is a leukemoid reaction. The patient has a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 66,500/mm³ with a normal differential and an elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score. These features do not align well with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which usually presents with a low LAP score. Instead, the elevated LAP suggests a reactive process, often due to an underlying cause such as infection, inflammation, or a stressor like a tumor. In contrast to leukemia, where immature or abnormal cells are often seen, the normal differential here suggests the body's response to an external factor rather than a primary bone marrow malignancy. Therefore, these findings are most consistent with a leukemoid reaction."}
{"question": "A young male with gallbladder stones presents with serum bilirubin levels of 2.5 mg/dL, hemoglobin levels of 6 g/dL, and a urine test positive for urobilinogen. Based on these findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms and lab results provided, the most likely diagnosis is hereditary spherocytosis. This condition is characterized by hemolytic anemia due to the abnormal shape and fragility of red blood cells, which leads to their premature destruction. The elevated bilirubin level stems from the increased breakdown of red blood cells, leading to higher levels of unconjugated bilirubin. This also aligns with the positive urine test for urobilinogen, as more bilirubin is converted in the gut. The presence of gallstones, particularly pigmented stones, is often associated with hereditary spherocytosis due to the chronic hemolysis and increased bilirubin load. Thus, hereditary spherocytosis effectively ties together the patient's anemia, elevated bilirubin, urobilinogen positivity, and gallstones."}
{"question": "What condition can present with conjunctival injection, pharyngeal injection, polymorphic rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms of conjunctival injection, pharyngeal injection, polymorphic rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy are characteristic of Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis that primarily affects children and presents with a fever lasting more than five days, alongside various other symptoms including those mentioned. The polymorphic rash and lymphadenopathy are particularly indicative of this condition. While not all symptoms may be present in every case, the combination of these features makes Kawasaki disease a likely diagnosis."}
{"question": "What is the most sensitive investigation for detecting an ampullary obstructive calculus in a patient with a history of choledocholithiasis, elevated conjugated bilirubin, and a dilated biliary system?", "gold_answer": "The most sensitive investigation for detecting an ampullary obstructive calculus, particularly in a patient with a history of choledocholithiasis, elevated conjugated bilirubin, and a dilated biliary system, is Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS). EUS provides high-resolution images and is particularly effective at identifying small or hard-to-detect stones, especially those located in the ampullary region, making it a highly sensitive option in this scenario."}
{"question": "What condition is indicated by an X-ray showing an air column between a soft tissue mass and the posterior wall of the nasopharynx?", "gold_answer": "An X-ray showing an air column between a soft tissue mass and the posterior wall of the nasopharynx could indicate the presence of an antrochoanal polyp. Antrochoanal polyps can expand from the sinuses into the nasopharynx, potentially displacing air to create such a column without causing complete obstruction. This condition is characterized by the growth of the polyp from the maxillary sinus and extending into the nasal cavity, where it may lead to the described radiographic finding."}
{"question": "A 10-year-old obese child from endocrinology department was referred to emergency for a painful limp with hip pain which of the following investigation is not required:\nA. X-ray of the hip\nB. MRI of the hip\nC. CT scan of hip\nD. USG of hip", "gold_answer": "For a 10-year-old child presenting with hip pain and a limp, particularly if slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is suspected, the initial imaging investigation typically involves an X-ray of the hip. This is crucial for diagnosing SCFE, as X-rays provide clear views of bone structures and any displacement of the femoral head.\n\nWhile MRI can be useful for more detailed soft tissue evaluation, and ultrasound can be beneficial in assessing joint effusion, they are generally not the first-line imaging techniques for suspected SCFE.\n\nCT scans, while effective for detailed bone imaging, are not routinely required for SCFE diagnosis in this context, especially given the radiation exposure involved. Therefore, among the options listed, a CT scan of the hip is not required as part of the initial investigation for SCFE in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: C. CT scan of hip"}
{"question": "A 6-month-old baby presents with severe pallor and hepatosplenomegaly, and there is a similar history in a sibling. What is the most appropriate investigation to perform to diagnose the underlying condition?", "gold_answer": "Given the presentation of a 6-month-old baby with severe pallor, hepatosplenomegaly, and a family history indicating a possible inherited blood disorder, the most appropriate investigation to carry out is a hemoglobin electrophoresis. This test will allow for the identification of abnormal hemoglobin patterns, which is crucial for diagnosing conditions such as thalassemia or other hemoglobinopathies. In this case, the presence of hemolytic anemia and familial tendencies strongly suggests a condition like beta-thalassemia major, and the hemoglobin electrophoresis would be instrumental in confirming this diagnosis."}
{"question": "A 35-year-old man undergoing a CT-guided percutaneous drainage procedure for a liver cyst experiences a sudden drop in oxygen saturation to 64%, an increased heart rate of 136/min, blood pressure of 86/58 mm Hg, and absent bilateral breath sounds, with no end tidal CO2 waveform detectable. Considering these clinical signs, what is the most appropriate immediate pharmacological intervention in this scenario?", "gold_answer": "In this clinical scenario, the patient's signs strongly suggest a tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate mechanical intervention such as needle decompression or chest tube insertion. While addressing the underlying mechanical issue is of utmost priority, pharmacological support can also be crucial in the interim to stabilize the patient. \n\nGiven the hypotension, the most appropriate immediate pharmacological intervention would be the administration of a vasopressor to support blood pressure and maintain perfusion until definitive treatment can be performed. In this context, epinephrine can be considered to help maintain circulation. However, it is critical to act swiftly with the mechanical intervention to resolve the tension pneumothorax, as this will provide the definitive life-saving treatment."}
{"question": "A 22 years old man presents with a solitary 2 cm space occupying lesion of mixed echogenecity in the right lobe of the liver on USG. The rest of the liver is normal. Which of the following test should be done next?\nA. Ultrasound guided biopsy of the lesion\nB. Hepatic scintigraphy\nC. Hepatic angiography\nD. Contrast enhanced CT scan of the liver", "gold_answer": "In the case of a 22-year-old man with a solitary 2 cm lesion of mixed echogenicity in the liver, it is important to consider the next non-invasive step before proceeding to more invasive procedures. At this young age, benign lesions such as hemangiomas or focal nodular hyperplasia are more likely. \n\nAmong the options provided, hepatic scintigraphy stands out as an effective non-invasive test that can provide functional information about the lesion, helping to differentiate between various types without immediate resort to invasive techniques. This makes it a suitable next step in characterizing the lesion in question, especially since the rest of the liver appears normal.\n\nTherefore, the next test that should be done is:\nB. Hepatic scintigraphy"}
{"question": "Considering a 78-year-old woman in New Jersey presenting with fever, lethargy, bloody urine, and hepatosplenomegaly in July, and laboratory findings showing hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated LDH with an absence of travel history, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 78-year-old woman from New Jersey is babesiosis. Babesiosis is a tick-borne illness primarily transmitted by the Ixodes scapularis tick, which is prevalent in the northeastern United States, including New Jersey, especially during the summer months. The clinical presentation of fever, lethargy, bloody urine (hematuria), and hepatosplenomegaly, along with laboratory findings of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated LDH, are consistent with babesiosis. The lack of recent travel further supports this diagnosis, as babesiosis is endemic to the area she resides in. It's important to consider local epidemiology, and given the symptoms and lab results, babesiosis emerges as the plausible cause of her condition. Further confirmation can be obtained through specific laboratory tests, such as a blood smear or PCR testing for Babesia parasites."}
{"question": "A 55-year-old man has been diagnosed with Stokes- Adams syndrome. Two minutes after the onset of syncopal attack, which of the following is the pacemaker of the hea?\nA. Sinus node\nB. A-V node\nC. Purkinje fibers\nD. Cardiac septum", "gold_answer": "The answer is C. Purkinje fibers. \n\nIn Stokes-Adams syndrome, episodes of syncope or fainting occur due to a transient cessation of effective heartbeats, often associated with heart block. If neither the sinus node nor the AV node is able to maintain a rhythm due to a severe block, such as a complete heart block, the Purkinje fibers can take over as a backup pacemaker. Although they provide a much slower heart rate, they can eventually restore enough cardiac output to regain consciousness, which aligns with the two-minute timeframe of the syncope."}
{"question": "A patient presents with signs of pneumonia, and the bacterium obtained from sputum is a gram-positive cocci showing alpha hemolysis on sheep agar. Which specific test would confirm that the organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae?", "gold_answer": "To confirm that the organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae, you can use the bile solubility test. While the optochin sensitivity test is widely used for identifying S. pneumoniae due to its convenience and speed, the bile solubility test is more definitive. S. pneumoniae will lyse in the presence of bile salts, which differentiates it from other alpha-hemolytic streptococci. This test provides a clear confirmation because it specifically targets a unique trait of S. pneumoniae."}
{"question": "A 37-year-old woman comes to the physician because of irregular menses and generalized fatigue for the past 4 months. Menses previously occurred at regular 25- to 29-day intervals and lasted for 5 days but now occur at 45- to 60-day intervals. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is 155 cm (5 ft 1 in) tall and weighs 89 kg (196 lb); BMI is 37 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 146/100 mm Hg.

Cushing syndrome\nB. Primary hyperaldosteronism\nC. Pheochromocytoma\nD. Polycystic ovarian syndrome\nE. Hypothyroidism", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the described symptoms and laboratory findings is ***Cushing syndrome (A)***. The woman presents with a constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities including irregular menses, fatigue, obesity (high BMI), hypertension, hirsutism, acne, ecchymotic patches (bruising), muscle weakness, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. These findings align closely with Cushing syndrome, which results from prolonged exposure to excess cortisol. Cortisol can cause these types of systemic effects, including metabolic imbalances and changes in physical appearance. Other conditions listed, such as primary hyperaldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hypothyroidism, do not account as comprehensively for the full range of observed symptoms and lab results."}
{"question": "A 63-year-old man with weakness in his lower legs that improves with exercise and throughout the day seeks evaluation. Considering his symptoms and examination findings, what specific test result would confirm the diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome in this patient?", "gold_answer": "To confirm the diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) in this patient, a specific test that would provide definitive evidence is the detection of anti-voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibodies in the blood. These antibodies are frequently present in individuals with LEMS and serve as a strong diagnostic marker for the condition."}
{"question": "A 38-year-old man undergoing chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma presents with white oral lesions that bleed when scraped off and intense pain while chewing. Based on the clinical presentation and history, what is the next best step in management for this patient?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical presentation described, the patient is likely experiencing oral candidiasis, commonly known as oral thrush. This condition is common in individuals undergoing chemotherapy due to their weakened immune systems. The white lesions that bleed when scraped and the associated pain are characteristic of this condition.\n\nThe next best step in managing this patient's oral thrush is to initiate antifungal treatment. Nystatin, an antifungal mouthwash or oral suspension, is typically used to treat localized oral candidiasis. It directly targets the affected area and is easy to administer, making it an appropriate choice in this case. Starting the patient on oral nystatin should help alleviate the lesions and the associated discomfort."}
{"question": "A 16-year-old boy recently arrived in the United States from Nigeria for a year of high school. He has developed a progressively pruritic rash over his shoulders and buttocks over the past 6 months and is experiencing difficulty reading the whiteboard in class. Examination shows symmetrically distributed papules with excoriation marks, patchy hyperpigmentation, inguinal lymphadenopathy, and firm subcutaneous nodules along the iliac crest. Skin snip biopsies incubated in saline reveal motile microfilariae. What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient's condition?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and findings you describe—itchy papular rash, visual difficulties, inguinal lymphadenopathy, subcutaneous nodules, and, critically, the presence of microfilariae in skin snip biopsies—are highly indicative of onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness. This condition is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus, transmitted by blackfly bites, and it is endemic in certain parts of Africa, including Nigeria. The combination of skin and ocular involvement along with the geographic context makes onchocerciasis the most likely diagnosis for this patient."}
{"question": "Raju, a 10 year old boy, is experiencing short lapses of awareness with eyelid fluttering every 5–10 minutes. EEG studies show brief 3 Hz spike and wave discharges synchronously in all leads. Which drug, effective for his condition, has the disadvantage of causing sedation and tolerance?", "gold_answer": "In Raju's case, where he is experiencing absence seizures characterized by brief lapses of awareness and the typical 3 Hz spike and wave discharges on the EEG, clonazepam can indeed be effective. However, it's important to note that clonazepam, a benzodiazepine, has the downside of causing sedation and the potential for developing tolerance over time. This makes it less ideal for long-term management compared to other first-line treatments such as ethosuximide or valproic acid, which are more commonly used for absence seizures without these particular drawbacks."}
{"question": "A patient presents with retinoblastoma, characterized by a single tumor in one eye. Which test could be used to determine if the tumor has a heritable or sporadic origin?", "gold_answer": "To determine whether the retinoblastoma has a heritable or sporadic origin, a genetic test for mutations in the RB1 gene can be conducted using a blood sample from the patient. This test identifies if there is a germline mutation present in the RB1 gene. If a mutation is found in the blood, it indicates a heritable form of retinoblastoma, as this mutation would be present in every cell of the body. If no mutation is detected in the blood, but one is identified in the tumor tissue, it suggests that the retinoblastoma might be sporadic, meaning the mutation is only in the retinal tumor cells and not inherited. Using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a common method for such genetic testing, allowing for the amplification and detection of specific DNA mutations within the RB1 gene. This approach, combined with a thorough assessment of family history and clinical features, provides a comprehensive understanding of the tumor's origin."}

Autosomal dominant\nB. Autosomal recessive\nC. X-linked disorder\nD. None of the above", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and laboratory findings presented in the question strongly indicate a urea cycle disorder, specifically ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. This condition is characterized by hyperammonemia, elevated urine orotic acid, high plasma glutamine levels, and low arginine levels, all of which align with the details given.\n\nOrnithine transcarbamylase deficiency is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. This means the disorder is linked to a gene on the X chromosome. Males, having only one X chromosome, are more likely to exhibit symptoms of the disease if they inherit the defective gene from their mother, who can be a carrier.\n\nThus, the pattern of inheritance for the disease described is:\n\nC. X-linked disorder"}
{"question": "What is the primary concern when managing a case of a child with a retained disc battery in the nose?", "gold_answer": "The primary concern when managing a case of a child with a retained disc battery in the nose is the urgent removal of the battery to prevent potential harm. Disc batteries, also known as button batteries, can cause severe damage rapidly due to both electrical burns and chemical leakage. When lodged in the nasal cavity, the battery can lead to tissue necrosis, septal perforation, and infection, which may begin occurring in a very short time frame. Therefore, the most critical initial step is to remove the battery as swiftly and safely as possible to minimize the risk of severe complications and long-term damage. Following removal, assessing for any tissue damage or infection and applying appropriate treatments is essential to ensure proper healing and recovery."}
{"question": "A 14-year-old boy presents with a swollen, red, and painful left knee, and joint aspiration reveals frank blood without a history of trauma. The history includes multiple swollen joints, frequent nosebleeds, and gum bleeding after dental visits. What is the most likely underlying diagnosis given these findings and family history considerations?", "gold_answer": "The most likely underlying diagnosis for the 14-year-old boy is hemophilia. The symptoms you've described—spontaneous joint bleeding, frequent nosebleeds, and gum bleeding after dental procedures—are characteristic of hemophilia, a genetic bleeding disorder. Hemophilia typically affects males due to its X-linked inheritance pattern, where the disorder is passed from carrier mothers to their sons. Given these clinical signs and the likely family history considerations, hemophilia is a fitting diagnosis."}
{"question": "A 25-year-old female presents with a fever lasting ten days and develops acute pain initially in the periumbilical region that spreads across the abdomen. What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms of a prolonged fever lasting for ten days and abdominal pain that started in the periumbilical region and spread across the abdomen, the most likely cause of her symptoms is typhoid fever. Typhoid fever, caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi, can present with prolonged fever, as well as abdominal pain that may start in one region before becoming more generalized. These symptoms align well with her clinical presentation, making typhoid fever a strong possibility in this case."}
{"question": "History of trauma with a stab injury to the right lower chest with low BP and low pulse rate. It can be improved with IV fluids and after resuscitation in the trauma center patient's BP becomes normal. A chest X-ray showed clear lung fields. What will be the next step-\nA. EFAST\nB. Keep immediate chest tube\nC. CECT abdomen\nD. CECT chest", "gold_answer": "The best next step in this scenario is a CECT chest (D). Given the location of the stab wound in the right lower chest and the initial stabilization of the patient’s vitals after resuscitation, it is important to assess for any potential thoracic injuries that could have been missed on the X-ray. A CECT chest will provide a comprehensive evaluation, helping to identify injuries to the diaphragm or other thoracic structures that were not visible on the X-ray."}
{"question": "A 72-year-old patient with Parkinsonism presents with swollen feet that are red, tender, and very painful. Which medication, if discontinued, could resolve these symptoms within a few days?", "gold_answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms of swollen, red, and painful feet, it is likely that amantadine is the medication related to these issues. Amantadine, which is sometimes used in the management of Parkinsonism, is known to cause peripheral edema and can also lead to other skin-related symptoms. If the edema and associated symptoms are due to amantadine, discontinuing the medication could result in a resolution of these symptoms within a few days. Therefore, stopping amantadine is a reasonable consideration to address the patient's condition."}
{"question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with intense anal pain during bowel movements for the past 4 weeks. The pain is dull and throbbing, accompanied by mild bright red rectal bleeding that worsens during defecation. Her anal sphincter tone is markedly increased, preventing finger introduction due to severe pain. Considering her history of practicing anal intercourse and the symptoms described, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms described are highly indicative of an anal fissure. Anal fissures are small tears in the lining of the anus and can cause significant pain, especially during bowel movements, along with bright red bleeding. The intense anal pain, particularly during defecation, the dull and throbbing nature of the pain, and the presence of increased anal sphincter tone strongly suggest this diagnosis. While her history of anal intercourse can indeed contribute to such an occurrence, the key symptoms align well with an anal fissure. Therefore, given all the clinical signs and patient history, an anal fissure is the most likely diagnosis."}
{"question": "A patient presents with nephritis, hematuria, hemoptysis, and the presence of antinuclear membrane antibodies. What is the likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The likely diagnosis for a patient presenting with nephritis, hematuria, hemoptysis, and the presence of antinuclear membrane antibodies is Goodpasture's syndrome. This condition is characterized by the presence of antibodies against the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes, explaining the kidney and lung involvement. The combination of these clinical findings aligns well with Goodpasture's syndrome."}
{"question": "What class of antihypertensive drugs is most recommended for treating hypertension in elderly patients?", "gold_answer": "Calcium channel blockers are often recommended for treating hypertension in elderly patients. They are particularly effective in addressing high systolic blood pressure, which is a common issue in older individuals. Calcium channel blockers, like amlodipine, are known for their ability to manage several cardiovascular issues with relatively minimal side effects compared to other antihypertensive drug classes. Additionally, they can offer benefits for conditions such as angina or certain vascular problems, which are also more prevalent in an aging population. Therefore, they are frequently advocated in clinical guidelines for use in elderly patients with hypertension."}
{"question": "A full-term neonate develops rapid and progressive respiratory distress shortly after birth. A post-mortem lung biopsy reveals findings typical of a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of surfactant and lipid-rich material within the alveoli. What is your diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The neonate's rapid and progressive respiratory distress right after birth, coupled with the autopsy findings of surfactant and lipid-rich material accumulation in the alveoli, aligns most closely with Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP). This rare condition, especially in a newborn, suggests a congenital form likely due to genetic defects affecting surfactant metabolism. The pathology observed is distinctive for PAP and doesn't match the more common causes of neonatal respiratory distress, supporting this diagnosis."}
{"question": "In the context of clonidine's use as an antihypertensive agent, what is the mechanism by which a fast intravenous injection of clonidine can lead to an increase in blood pressure?", "gold_answer": "When clonidine is administered via a fast intravenous injection, it can initially cause an increase in blood pressure due to its action on peripheral alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. Although clonidine is primarily known for its central action, where it activates alpha-2 receptors in the brain to reduce sympathetic outflow and lower blood pressure, a rapid increase in systemic clonidine levels from fast intravenous administration allows it to act primarily on peripheral receptors initially. This peripheral stimulation can lead to a transient vasoconstriction, temporarily raising blood pressure. However, this effect is short-lived; as clonidine begins to exert its central effects, the overall result is a reduction in blood pressure as the sympathetic nervous activity decreases."}
{"question": "Based on the presentation of a 2-year-old boy with cough, fever, difficulty in breathing, a respiratory rate of 50/min, no chest indrawing, and bilateral crepitations on chest auscultation, what is the most probable diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms you've described, the most probable diagnosis for the 2-year-old boy is pneumonia. The key indicators were the cough, fever, rapid breathing rate of 50 breaths per minute, and bilateral crepitations heard on chest auscultation, all of which are typical signs of pneumonia in children. The lack of chest indrawing suggests that while there is respiratory involvement, it may not be severe respiratory distress at this moment. Pneumonia is indeed common in young children and often presents with these symptoms, making it the most likely diagnosis in this scenario."}
{"question": "A 17-year-old girl presents with left lower abdominal pain of moderate intensity, having experienced similar episodes monthly over the past 5 months. Her menstrual cycle is regular with no abnormalities found on a recent examination or urine pregnancy test. Given this clinical scenario, what is the most appropriate management approach for her condition?", "gold_answer": "Given the clinical scenario of a 17-year-old girl with left lower abdominal pain occurring monthly in relation to her menstrual cycle, and considering that her examination and tests, including a pregnancy test, are normal, the most appropriate management approach is reassurance and education. This pain is often related to ovulation (mittelschmerz) or menstrual cramps (primary dysmenorrhea). Initially, educating her about the nature of her pain can be reassuring, as such experiences are common at her age.\n\nFor symptom management, starting with NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can be effective. NSAIDs work by reducing prostaglandin levels, which in turn alleviates menstrual cramps and ovulation-related pain. If NSAIDs do not provide sufficient relief over time, exploring hormonal contraceptive options to suppress ovulation and reduce such cyclical pain might be considered as a subsequent step. For now, NSAIDs are the primary recommendation for pain relief."}
{"question": "A middle-aged female presents with pain and tenderness at the base of her thumb, along with a history of chronic wrist overuse. During the physical examination, the doctor performed Finkelstein's test, asking the patient to make a fist with her thumb inside and then bend her wrist towards her little finger, which elicited pain. Identify the two tendons involved in this condition.", "gold_answer": "The condition you are describing is De Quervain's tenosynovitis, which typically involves the inflammation of two tendons in the wrist: the abductor pollicis longus and the extensor pollicis brevis. These tendons are crucial in controlling thumb movement and can become inflamed due to repetitive use, especially with activities that involve grasping or twisting. The pain elicited by Finkelstein's test is a common diagnostic sign of this condition."}
{"question": "What chemical compound is responsible for the greenish discoloration of the body first seen in the right iliac fossa after death?", "gold_answer": "The greenish discoloration first seen in the right iliac fossa after death is primarily due to the formation of sulfhemoglobin. This compound arises when bacteria in the gut produce hydrogen sulfide, which then reacts with hemoglobin in the blood. This reaction leads to the distinctive early color change noted during the decomposition process."}
{"question": "In a 58-year-old woman diagnosed with locally advanced breast cancer, who also has a history of myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, which class of antineoplastic drugs is best avoided due to potential cardiac toxicity?", "gold_answer": "In the case of a 58-year-old woman with locally advanced breast cancer and a history of myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, it is advisable to avoid anthracyclines. This class of antineoplastic drugs, which includes agents such as doxorubicin, is known for its efficacy in treating certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. However, it is also associated with significant cardiac toxicity, particularly cardiomyopathy, which can exacerbate existing heart conditions. Given her cardiac history, using anthracyclines could pose an undue risk to her heart health. Therefore, alternative chemotherapy regimens that are less cardiotoxic should be considered in her treatment plan."}
{"question": "A person who was completely immunized against tetanus 10 years ago presents with a clean wound received 2.5 hours ago without any lacerations. What is the appropriate medical intervention for tetanus prophylaxis in this case?", "gold_answer": "In the scenario you described, the person received their last tetanus vaccination exactly 10 years ago and now has a clean and minor wound. According to tetanus prophylaxis guidelines, for clean and minor wounds, a tetanus booster is not typically necessary if the person has been vaccinated within the last 10 years. Since they are at the 10-year mark, they fall within the typical guideline period, and a booster is not urgently required. However, it's often recommended to get a booster if it's exactly 10 years since the last dose, as a precaution and to maintain ongoing immunity. Therefore, while immediate vaccination for this clean and minor wound is not obligatory, it would be prudent to consider updating their booster during their next medical check-up to ensure continued protection against tetanus."}
{"question": "What is the term used to describe the problem in distinguishing entry from exit wounds after surgical alteration or suturing of gunshot wounds?", "gold_answer": "The term used to describe the challenge in distinguishing entry from exit wounds after surgical intervention, such as suturing, is known as the \"Kennedy phenomenon.\" This phenomenon specifically refers to the difficulties forensic experts encounter in accurately identifying and interpreting gunshot wounds when surgical procedures have altered the wound characteristics, obscuring the typical features that differentiate entry wounds from exit wounds."}
{"question": "A 25-year-old sexually active unmarried male presents with urethral discharge after unprotected sex with a sex worker, and a Gram stain of the discharge shows gram-negative diplococci. What is the organism responsible for this condition?", "gold_answer": "The organism responsible for the condition described, given the urethral discharge and Gram stain showing gram-negative diplococci, is Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This fits the classic presentation of gonorrhea, especially following unprotected sexual contact."}
{"question": "When a patient with breast cancer presents with a peau d'orange appearance on inspection, what is the T stage classification of the tumor?", "gold_answer": "When a patient with breast cancer presents with a peau d'orange appearance on inspection, and there are no signs of inflammatory breast cancer, the T stage classification of the tumor is T4b. If the peau d'orange is associated with inflammatory breast cancer, characterized by redness, swelling, and affecting a large portion of the breast, it would be classified as T4d."}
{"question": "A 22-year-old man presents to his primary care provider because of fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. He has returned from Dhaka, Bangladesh recently where he was visiting his relatives. He is diagnosed with Shigella infection, and ciprofloxacin is started. He develops severe nausea and weakness 2 days later and complains of passing dark urine. The lab test results reveal a hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, increased unconjugated bilirubin, increased reticulocyte count, increased lactate dehydrogenase, and increased blood urea. Which of the following is the best next step for the diagnosis of this patient’s condition?\nA. Hemoglobin electrophoresis\nB. Direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test\nC. Eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding test\nD. ADAMTS-13 activity assay\nE. Glucose-6-phosphate spectrophotometry", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and laboratory findings strongly suggest hemolytic anemia due to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, especially considering the onset shortly after starting ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin can induce oxidative stress in individuals with G6PD deficiency, leading to hemolysis. To confirm this suspicion, the best next step for diagnosing the patient's condition is option E: Glucose-6-phosphate spectrophotometry, which tests for G6PD enzyme activity. This test will help determine if the hemolysis is due to a G6PD deficiency, supporting the clinical suspicion based on the patient's symptoms and treatment history."}
{"question": "A 69-year-old retired demolition foreman presents with a 4-month history of progressive fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, and has recently experienced blood-tinged sputum. Physical examination reveals dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. CT imaging shows a left-sided pleural effusion and circumferential pleural thickening with calcifications on the left hemithorax. Based on these findings, what is the pathological characteristic expected in the biopsy specimen of the pleural thickening?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and CT imaging results, the retired demolition foreman's case is highly suggestive of malignant pleural mesothelioma, particularly considering his probable asbestos exposure history. The pathological characteristic expected in the biopsy specimen of the pleural thickening would reveal malignant mesothelial cells. This includes a biphasic pattern with the presence of epithelioid and sarcomatoid cells. Upon further examination, the mesothelial cells typically display surface microvilli and can be identified by positive staining for markers such as calretinin in immunohistochemistry. These features are crucial for differentiating malignant pleural mesothelioma from other conditions."}
{"question": "A 26 year-old man presents to his primary physician with complaints of intermittent crampy epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting sholy after eating.

Gallstone pancreatits\nB. Pancreatic carcinoma\nC. Pancreas divisum\nD. Annular pancreas", "gold_answer": "The most probable diagnosis for this 26-year-old man, considering his lifelong symptoms and the barium study showing a markedly narrowed second portion of the duodenum, is D. Annular pancreas. This condition occurs when pancreatic tissue encircles the duodenum, leading to obstruction and the associated symptoms he is experiencing."}
{"question": "A new assay for Lyme disease has been developed. While the assay has been tested extensively in Maine, a group of inventors are planning to test it in Southern California. In comparison to the assay's performance in Maine, testing the assay in Southern California would affect the performance of the assay in which of the following ways?\nA. Decrease negative likelihood ratio of the Lyme disease assay\nB. Lower likelihood that a patient without Lyme disease truly has a negative test\nC. Greater likelihood that an individual with a positive test will truly have Lyme disease\nD. Decreased positive likelihood ratio of the Lyme disease assay\nE. Greater likelihood that an individual with a negative test will truly not have Lyme disease\n\"", "gold_answer": "Testing the Lyme disease assay in Southern California, due to the lower prevalence of the disease compared to Maine, will affect the test's performance in terms of predictive values. Specifically, the negative predictive value (NPV) is likely to increase. This means that there is a greater likelihood that an individual with a negative test result truly does not have Lyme disease because the disease is less common in that region. Therefore, the correct choice is:\n\nE. Greater likelihood that an individual with a negative test will truly not have Lyme disease"}
{"question": "In a 32yr old male presenting with the following blood chemistry Na+ - 135,K+ - 5.0, HCO3- - 14.0, Cl- - 116, PO4-- - 5.0, S04-- - 5.0, Mg++ - 2.0, Ca++- 8.0 the anion gap is :\nA. 20\nB. 15\nC. 13\nD. 10", "gold_answer": "To calculate the anion gap, you use the formula: Anion Gap = Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-). Given the values: Na+ = 135 mmol/L, Cl- = 116 mmol/L, and HCO3- = 14 mmol/L, the calculation is as follows:\n\n1. Add Cl- and HCO3-: 116 + 14 = 130\n2. Subtract this sum from Na+: 135 - 130 = 5\n\nHowever, this calculated anion gap of 5 mmol/L does not match any of the answer choices directly. Typically, a normal anion gap is considered to be around 8-12 mmol/L, and deviations can be due to various factors or adjustments in interpreting clinical data. \n\nGiven the choices and educational context, selecting:\nD. 10 \ncan be considered a more reasonable assumption, acknowledging possible typical rounding or educational approximations that align with practical clinical settings."}
{"question": "What is the most common cause of early onset menarche in a 9-year-old girl who experienced thelarche at age 7 and adrenarche at age 8?", "gold_answer": "The most common cause of early onset menarche in a 9-year-old girl who experienced thelarche at age 7 and adrenarche at age 8 is idiopathic central precocious puberty. This condition occurs when the body's hormone regulation system activates earlier than usual without any identifiable underlying cause. In girls, this is often the case, where no specific reason can be determined, leading to the early onset of puberty."}
{"question": "What is the most likely causative agent of gastroenteritis in a youth group camp if the water consumed was not chlorinated or filtered, sourced from a spring contaminated by run-off from nearby farmland grazed by cattle and sheep, and if the organism isolated required an atmosphere with reduced oxygen and increased carbon dioxide for growth, was mostly self-limiting, but responded to erythromycin when treated?", "gold_answer": "The most likely causative agent of the gastroenteritis outbreak at the youth camp is Campylobacter. This bacterial pathogen is commonly linked to poorly treated or contaminated water, especially when sourced from areas with animal run-off, such as farms with cattle and sheep. Campylobacter requires a microaerophilic environment, meaning it grows best in conditions with reduced oxygen and elevated carbon dioxide, which aligns with the specific atmospheric growth needs mentioned. Moreover, Campylobacter infections are typically self-limiting but can respond to treatment with erythromycin, further supporting it as the likely cause in this scenario."}
{"question": "A 21-year-old woman presents with a 4-month history of fatigue, frequent episodes of binge eating followed by self-induced vomiting, daily exercise aimed at weight loss, knuckle calluses, bilateral parotid gland enlargement, and eroded dental enamel. Given her symptoms and physical examination findings, what is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for her diagnosed condition?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and physical examination findings in this young woman are indicative of bulimia nervosa. For treating bulimia nervosa, fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. Fluoxetine is the only medication specifically approved by the FDA for treating this condition and is effective in reducing binge-purge cycles. Therefore, based on her condition, fluoxetine is the recommended treatment."}
{"question": "What is the foremost line of treatment for a 6-year-old female child with proclined upper anteriors, a history of prolonged bottle-feeding, a persistent thumb sucking habit, and clinical findings of anterior open bite, proclined upper anterior teeth, retroclined lower anterior teeth, and tongue thrusting?", "gold_answer": "The foremost line of treatment for a 6-year-old with proclined upper anterior teeth, retroclined lower anterior teeth, anterior open bite, and habits like thumb sucking, prolonged bottle-feeding, and tongue thrusting is to address the causative habits. \n\nFirstly, the focus should be on discontinuing thumb sucking and prolonged bottle feeding. These habits are significant contributors to the dental issues observed. Employing both behavioral and mechanical interventions is beneficial:\n\n1. **Behavioral Modification**: Use positive reinforcement techniques to discourage thumb sucking. This involves setting clear goals and offering rewards when the child avoids the habit. Caregiver involvement is crucial, as they can provide consistent encouragement and track progress.\n\n2. **Habit-breaking Appliance**: Consider using a crib appliance or similar device. This mechanical intervention serves as a physical barrier to prevent thumb sucking and help correct tongue placement during swallowing or at rest.\n\n3. **Tongue Thrust Intervention**: While the crib appliance may partially address tongue thrusting, additional guidance from a speech therapist or specialist in orofacial myofunctional therapy could be beneficial to teach the child proper tongue positioning.\n\nIt's also essential to evaluate if there is any underlying emotional or psychological factor contributing to these habits, as addressing those can support a more comprehensive treatment approach.\n\nBy focusing initially on breaking these habits, there’s a significant potential to not only improve the current dental issues but also to prevent further misalignment, setting a better foundation for any necessary future orthodontic interventions."}
{"question": "What is the typical time frame for excision of areas with third-degree or deep second-degree burns in a patient, such as the one described in the scenario with multiple burns and signs of agitation, hypotension, and tachycardia?", "gold_answer": "The typical time frame for excision of areas with third-degree or deep second-degree burns in a patient, such as the one described, is usually within the first 2 to 7 days after the burn injury. This timing allows for stabilization of the patient while aiming to reduce risks of infection and other complications. Early intervention is often preferred once the patient is stable enough to undergo surgery."}
{"question": "A patient who recently received a blood transfusion presents with characteristics of acute hepatitis. Identify the specific serological markers indicative of an acute phase infection with the hepatitis B virus.", "gold_answer": "The serological markers indicative of an acute hepatitis B virus infection are the presence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc), and Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). These markers suggest a recent infection and active viral replication, distinguishing it from chronic infections or other types of hepatitis."}
{"question": "A 34-year-old woman at 32 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital with painless vaginal bleeding and a history of two previous cesarean sections. Her vital signs are stable, and the fetal heart rate is normal. What diagnostic investigation should be performed to confirm the suspected diagnosis in this case of painless vaginal bleeding?", "gold_answer": "In the case of a 34-year-old woman who is 32 weeks pregnant and experiencing painless vaginal bleeding, with a history of two previous cesarean sections, the concern for placenta previa is valid. To confirm the suspected diagnosis of placenta previa, the most appropriate diagnostic tool is an ultrasound. \n\nWhile a transabdominal ultrasound is often the initial step in assessing the placenta's position, a transvaginal ultrasound is more accurate for diagnosing placenta previa. The transvaginal ultrasound provides a clearer and more precise view of the relationship between the placenta and the cervical os, which is crucial for a definitive diagnosis. Despite being more invasive than the transabdominal approach, a transvaginal ultrasound is safe in the hands of trained practitioners and offers the detailed information necessary to guide further management of the pregnancy. Therefore, a transvaginal ultrasound should be performed to confirm the diagnosis in this scenario."}
{"question": "An American doctor is on an outreach trip to visit local communities in Ethiopia. In one clinic, he found many cases of children ages 2–5 years who have significantly low weight and height for their age. These children also had pale sclerae, distended abdomens, dermatoses, and marked edema in the lower extremities.

Which of the following amino acids must be included for these patients?\nA. Alanine\nB. Tyrosine\nC. Arginine\nD. Methionine", "gold_answer": "The children described are experiencing symptoms consistent with kwashiorkor, a form of protein malnutrition. In addressing this condition, it is crucial to provide all essential amino acids in the diet, as these cannot be synthesized by the body and must be ingested through nutrition. Among the options given, Methionine is an essential amino acid that must be included in the nutritional supplementation for these patients. Therefore, the correct choice is:\n\nD. Methionine"}
{"question": "An 83-year-old man with a history of severe dementia and recent pneumonia treatment presents with recurrent episodes of confusion and agitation in the hospital setting. Considering his current symptoms and behavior, what is the most appropriate pharmacological intervention to manage his acute agitation and confusion, aside from reorientation?", "gold_answer": "In the case of an 83-year-old man with severe dementia and recent pneumonia who is experiencing acute confusion and agitation, a cautious approach is warranted. Delirium secondary to the pneumonia and the underlying dementia likely contribute to his current symptoms. \n\nIn such situations, a typical intervention involves the use of antipsychotics. Haloperidol is commonly selected due to its rapid onset of action and effectiveness in controlling agitation. However, it is crucial to use the lowest effective dose possible, given the patient's age and the risks associated with antipsychotic use in elderly individuals, particularly those with dementia. Closely monitoring the patient for any side effects or complications is essential. \n\nWhile reorientation and non-pharmacological interventions should always be prioritized, a low-dose haloperidol can be a suitable choice in this acute setting to manage his symptoms."}
{"question": "What is the probable diagnosis for a 45-year-old patient who presents with conductive hearing loss, facial pain in the temporoparietal and lower jaw area, and an immobile soft palate on the right side?", "gold_answer": "The probable diagnosis for a 45-year-old patient with conductive hearing loss, facial pain in the temporoparietal and lower jaw area, and an immobile soft palate on the right side could be jugular foramen syndrome, also known as Vernet's syndrome. This condition arises due to lesions or tumors at the skull base, particularly affecting the jugular foramen, where cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal), X (vagus), and XI (accessory) pass through. Such a lesion could explain the diverse symptoms of hearing loss, facial pain, and soft palate immobility, as it impacts multiple cranial nerves serving these functions. A glomus jugulare tumor is a possible cause that could lead to this presentation by pressing on the structures exiting the jugular foramen."}
{"question": "A 45-year-old man with chronic renal failure develops a condition known as rugger jersey spine. What is the probable underlying cause of this condition in the context of his renal disease?", "gold_answer": "Rugger jersey spine in the context of chronic renal failure is primarily caused by secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a common complication of renal osteodystrophy. When the kidneys fail to function properly, they can't excrete phosphate efficiently, leading to hyperphosphatemia. This imbalance causes a drop in calcium levels, triggering an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion as the body attempts to correct the calcium deficit. The excess PTH increases bone turnover and resorption, leading to bone changes such as osteitis fibrosa cystica. These changes manifest as sclerosis and lytic lesions in the bones, notably in the spine, resulting in the distinctive radiological feature of rugger jersey spine. Thus, the probable underlying cause of rugger jersey spine in this patient is the secondary hyperparathyroidism induced by his chronic renal failure."}
{"question": "What are two characteristics associated with an amoebic liver abscess in terms of lobe occurrence and potential complications?", "gold_answer": "Amoebic liver abscesses most commonly occur in the right lobe of the liver due to its larger size and greater blood supply, which makes it more susceptible to infection. One of the potential complications of an amoebic liver abscess, if left untreated, is rupture. This rupture can lead to the abscess spreading into the peritoneal cavity or extending into the thorax, both of which are serious and potentially life-threatening conditions."}
{"question": "What is the principle of the Paul Bunnel test used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis in a 20-year-old male with a history of fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and sore throat?", "gold_answer": "The Paul Bunnel test, used to help diagnose infectious mononucleosis, operates on the principle of detecting heterophile antibodies. In individuals infected with the Epstein-Barr virus, which commonly causes infectious mononucleosis, the immune system generates these heterophile antibodies. These antibodies are known to nonspecifically bind to and react with antigens found on the red blood cells of certain animals, such as sheep or horses.\n\nTo detect these antibodies, the test involves mixing the patient's serum with sheep or horse red blood cells. If heterophile antibodies are present, they will cause the red blood cells to agglutinate or clump together. The presence of this agglutination signifies a positive result, suggesting an Epstein-Barr virus infection. This method is traditionally used to complement the clinical symptoms of fever, sore throat, and enlarged lymph nodes to confirm the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis."}
{"question": "What functional deficit would a patient exhibit if a viral infection caused damage to both hippocampi?", "gold_answer": "If a viral infection were to cause damage to both hippocampi, the primary functional deficit the patient would exhibit is anterograde amnesia. This means the patient would have significant difficulty forming new memories related to personal experiences and factual information, known as episodic and declarative memories. While memories formed before the damage typically remain intact, the ability to acquire new information and create new personal memories would be severely impaired. Additionally, spatial navigation and understanding of new environments may also be affected, although procedural memories, such as skills like riding a bike, would generally remain unaffected because these rely on different brain regions."}
{"question": "In an inflammatory response to infection, if the inflammatory infiltrate is predominantly composed of neutrophils for an extended period beyond the usual 24-48 hours, which organism is most likely responsible for this prolonged neutrophil presence?", "gold_answer": "In an inflammatory response to infection, if the inflammatory infiltrate is predominantly composed of neutrophils for an extended period beyond the usual 24-48 hours, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a likely candidate. This organism is known for causing persistent infections due to its ability to evade the immune system and form biofilms, making it difficult for the body to clear the infection and resulting in prolonged neutrophil presence."}
{"question": "A couple with a family history of beta thalassemia major has come for counseling. If the husband has an HbA2 level of 4.8% and the wife has an HbA2 level of 2.3%, what is the risk of them having a child with beta thalassemia major?", "gold_answer": "To determine the risk of a couple having a child with beta thalassemia major, both parents need to be carriers of the beta thalassemia trait. This is because beta thalassemia major is an autosomal recessive condition, meaning the child must inherit one mutated gene from each parent. \n\nIn this case, the husband's HbA2 level is 4.8%, which indicates he is likely a carrier of beta thalassemia (since an HbA2 level above 3.5% is typically suggestive of carrier status). On the other hand, the wife's HbA2 level is 2.3%, within the normal range (usually 2.2% to 3.2%), suggesting that she is not a carrier of the beta thalassemia trait.\n\nSince the wife is not a carrier, she cannot pass a mutated gene to their child. Therefore, the child cannot have beta thalassemia major because they would only inherit one mutated gene at most—from the husband. Consequently, the risk of them having a child with beta thalassemia major is essentially nonexistent. Their child may be a carrier if they inherit the mutated gene from the husband, but they will not have the condition itself."}
{"question": "A 4-year-old child comes to you with a history of dog bite from a street dog. This child had already received Rabies vaccine last year (full course). What will be your next course of action with regard to immunization:\nA. Repeat the entire schedule of Rabies vaccine\nB. No further dosages of Rabies vaccines required\nC.

{"question": "What is the major neurotransmitter released at the end organ effectors of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system?", "gold_answer": "The major neurotransmitter released at the end organ effectors of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is norepinephrine. This neurotransmitter plays a crucial role in activating the 'fight or flight' response, affecting various organs such as the heart and muscles by binding to adrenergic receptors and facilitating appropriate physiological reactions."}
{"question": "A patient present with lower gastrointestinal bleed. Sigmoidoscopy shows ulcers in the sigmoid. Biopsy from this area shows flask-shaped ulcers. Which of to following is the most appropriate treatment -\nA. Intravenous ceftriaxone\nB. Intravenous metronidazole\nC. Intravenous steroids and sulphasalazine\nD. Hydrocortisone enemas", "gold_answer": "The most appropriate treatment for a patient with a lower gastrointestinal bleed showing flask-shaped ulcers upon biopsy, which suggests an infection by Entamoeba histolytica, is Option B: Intravenous metronidazole. Metronidazole is an effective antiprotozoal agent used to treat amoebic colitis caused by this specific parasite."}
{"question": "In the case of a six-year-old child with an obstructed hernia where the bowel is found to be gangrenous, what is the recommended method for performing an anastomosis?", "gold_answer": "In the case of a six-year-old child with an obstructed hernia where the bowel has become gangrenous, the recommended course of action involves first removing the gangrenous section of the bowel to prevent further complications. Following the resection, the preferred method for performing an anastomosis is typically an end-to-end anastomosis if the remaining bowel tissue appears viable and the risk of infection is manageable. This approach leverages the child's ability to heal effectively and aims to restore bowel continuity as directly as possible. However, the decision must account for the potential risk of infection or poor tissue condition, in which case a temporary stoma might be considered to allow for stabilization before anastomosis. Generally, if conditions permit, immediate primary anastomosis is often feasible and beneficial in pediatric cases, minimizing complexity and promoting quicker recovery."}
{"question": "A 5-year-old boy presents to his pediatrician along with his parents due to episodes of “staring into space.” This symptom occurs several times a day and lasts only a few seconds. During these episodes, the boy does not respond to verbal or physical stimulation, and his parents deny him falling down or shaking. After the episode, the boy returns to his normal activity and is not confused. The parents deny any history of head trauma, recent medication use, or infection. Neurological exam is unremarkable. His episode is precipitated as he blows at a pinwheel. An EEG is performed, which shows 3-Hz spike and waveform. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?\nA. Ethosuximide\nB. Levetiracetam\nC. Lamotrigine\nD. Zonisamide", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and the EEG findings you described are characteristic of absence seizures. These seizures are marked by brief episodes of staring, lack of response, and an immediate return to normal activity without postictal confusion. The 3-Hz spike-and-wave pattern on EEG further supports this diagnosis.\n\nFor treating absence seizures, ethosuximide is the first-line medication, especially in children, due to its effectiveness and safety profile in managing these specific seizure types. Other options like levetiracetam and lamotrigine are used for different types of seizures but are not typically first-line for absence seizures.\n\nTherefore, the best treatment option for the patient described is:\n\nA. Ethosuximide"}
{"question": "A 62-year-old man with a history of diabetes and hypertension is brought to the emergency department with confusion and somnolence. He presents with tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, and laboratory findings of hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 1,299 mg/dL, hypokalemia (K+: 3.0 mEq/L), and elevated BUN. Given these clinical findings, what is the most appropriate initial treatment approach?", "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest that the patient is likely experiencing a Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS), characterized by extremely high blood glucose levels, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances, without the ketoacidosis typical of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). In managing HHS, the most crucial initial steps are rehydration and correcting electrolyte imbalances.\n\nThe most appropriate initial treatment approach is to start with intravenous (IV) fluids to address the likely severe dehydration. Isotonic saline (0.9% normal saline) is commonly used to restore intravascular volume. Alongside fluid replacement, it's essential to address the hypokalemia by administering potassium. This is crucial because when insulin therapy is eventually introduced to manage hyperglycemia, it can cause a further decrease in potassium levels, potentially leading to dangerous cardiac arrhythmias.\n\nTherefore, immediate treatment should focus on:\n1. Initiating IV fluid therapy with isotonic saline to manage dehydration and improve circulation.\n2. Correcting hypokalemia by administering potassium to bring levels to a safe range before starting insulin therapy.\n\nThese initial steps are critical for stabilizing the patient and setting the stage for subsequent management of their hyperglycemia."}

{"question": "A 10-year-old boy with nephrotic syndrome presents with difficulty in breathing and slightly reduced breath sounds on the right infra-axillary region, suggesting pleural effusion. What is the most appropriate imaging modality to confirm the presence of pleural effusion in this case?", "gold_answer": "The most appropriate imaging modality to confirm the presence of pleural effusion in a 10-year-old boy with nephrotic syndrome is an ultrasound. Ultrasound is highly sensitive in detecting pleural fluid, can identify even small effusions, and doesn't involve radiation, making it particularly suitable for children. Additionally, ultrasound can assist in guiding any necessary procedures, such as fluid aspiration, providing real-time imaging that adds to its utility in this scenario."}
{"question": "A 30-year-old woman reports feeling nauseous and fatigued for 3 weeks, with irregular menstrual cycles occurring every 24 to 33 days. Her last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago. The physical examination reveals an enlarged uterus, and her serum β-hCG concentration is elevated at 96,000 mIU/mL. Based on these findings and an abdominal ultrasound, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is a molar pregnancy, also known as a hydatidiform mole. The combination of symptoms such as nausea, fatigue, an irregular menstrual cycle with her last period being 7 weeks ago, an enlarged uterus on physical examination, and notably high serum β-hCG level at 96,000 mIU/mL aligns with a molar pregnancy. \n\nIn a molar pregnancy, the trophoblastic tissue, which normally develops into the placenta, grows abnormally and forms a mass of cysts. This often leads to elevated β-hCG levels significantly higher than expected for the gestational age, as seen in this case. The ultrasound further confirms the diagnosis by typically showing a \"snowstorm\" or \"cluster of grapes\" appearance, which is characteristic of a molar pregnancy. \n\nWhile high β-hCG levels can also be seen in multiple pregnancies, the absence of fetal parts and the strengthening evidence from the ultrasound findings support the diagnosis of a hydatidiform mole as the most probable explanation for the symptoms and test results presented."}
{"question": "A child developed respiratory distress and had a scaphoid abdomen two days after birth, with decreased breath sounds on the left side. After bag and mask ventilation, an endotracheal tube was placed, causing the maximal cardiac impulse to shift to the right side. What is the next step in management?", "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation you described, with respiratory distress, a scaphoid abdomen, and decreased breath sounds on the left side in a newborn, suggests a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. In this condition, abdominal contents can herniate into the thoracic cavity, leading to underdeveloped lungs and difficulty in breathing.\n\nThe use of bag and mask ventilation can worsen the situation by inflating the stomach, leading to further compression of the thoracic structures. This can cause a mediastinal shift, as appears to have happened with the heart's maximal impulse shifting to the right after intubation.\n\nThe immediate next step in management should be to decompress the stomach to relieve intrathoracic pressure from the distended abdominal contents. This is typically done by inserting an orogastric tube to allow air and gastric contents to escape, reducing pressure on the lungs and heart, and thereby facilitating improved ventilation and stabilization of the newborn’s condition."}
{"question": "A pregnant mother at 32 weeks gestation presents in preterm labour, and therapy with antenatal steroids is being considered to induce lung maturity in the fetus. Under which maternal condition should antenatal steroids not be administered?", "gold_answer": "Antenatal steroids should not be administered if the mother has chorioamnionitis. This condition, which is an infection of the amniotic fluid or membranes, presents a significant concern because giving steroids could potentially worsen the infection due to their immunosuppressive effects. Thus, in the presence of chorioamnionitis, it is best to avoid the use of antenatal steroids."}
{"question": "In a 49-year-old man with liver cirrhosis, abdominal discomfort, fever, decreased urination, jaundice, tense ascites, and pitting edema, what finding in the urine examination would exclude the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome?", "gold_answer": "To exclude the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) in this patient with liver cirrhosis, the key finding in the urine examination would be the presence of significant proteinuria or hematuria. In HRS, the kidneys are structurally intact, so one would typically not expect to see significant amounts of protein or blood in the urine. If either of these findings is present, it would suggest a different kind of kidney pathology, such as glomerulonephritis, rather than HRS. Thus, significant proteinuria or hematuria in the urine examination would exclude HRS as a diagnosis."}
{"question": "What preventive measure should be given to a 4-year-old girl with sickle cell disease to protect against infections, considering she was started on hydroxyurea and has had no painful crises or acute chest episodes since starting the medication?", "gold_answer": "For a 4-year-old girl with sickle cell disease, a key preventive measure against infections is the administration of prophylactic penicillin. This should be continued daily as a safeguard against serious bacterial infections, particularly from Streptococcus pneumoniae, given that her spleen may not function optimally. It's also crucial to ensure that her vaccinations are up-to-date. This includes vaccines against pneumococcus, meningococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b, which offer critical protection against potential infections. Even though hydroxyurea is effective in managing sickle cell disease and reducing pain episodes and severe complications, it does not protect against infections. Therefore, maintaining the prophylactic penicillin regimen and ensuring proper vaccination are essential for her protection."}
{"question": "A 30-year-old man presents with 6/5 unaided vision in each eye and has a cycloplegic retinoscopy result of +1.0 D sph. at a 1-metre distance. He reports experiencing blurring of newsprint at 30 cm, which clears up in about two minutes. Based on these symptoms and findings, what is the most probable diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided, the most probable diagnosis for this 30-year-old man is latent hyperopia. Latent hyperopia occurs when a person has a form of farsightedness that isn't immediately evident because their eyes are compensating for it through the process of accommodation. In his case, the cycloplegic retinoscopy result of +1.0 diopters sph at a 1-meter distance (adjusted to about +2.0 diopters for the standard testing conditions) supports this diagnosis, as it indicates hyperopia. \n\nWhile his unaided vision of 6/5 suggests excellent distance vision, his difficulty in reading newsprint at 30 cm, which improves after two minutes, suggests that his eyes are over-accommodating to bring near objects into clear focus. This overworking can eventually lead to tiredness or an inability to maintain clear near vision, causing the initial blur he experiences.\n\nOverall, his symptoms and test results align with latent hyperopia, where the eyes mask part of the farsightedness by compensating for it, but this compensation fails during more prolonged or intense near work like reading."}
{"question": "A 36-year-old woman is experiencing frequent unilateral, throbbing headaches accompanied by severe nausea that incapacitates her from performing daily activities. These headaches have increased in frequency to 2-3 times a week and do not respond well to her current treatment with ibuprofen. Considering her medical history, including treated hypertension, what is the most appropriate medication for the long-term prevention of her headaches?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms and medical history described, propranolol would be an appropriate choice for the long-term prevention of her migraines. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is often used to help prevent migraines and also effectively manages hypertension, addressing both her headache prevention needs and her blood pressure control. Utilizing propranolol could help reduce the frequency and severity of her migraines, providing a more comprehensive treatment approach than her current regimen with ibuprofen."}
{"question": "A 38-year-old woman seeks evaluation at the emergency room for sudden onset of pain and swelling of her left leg since last night. Her family history is significant for maternal breast cancer (diagnosed at 52 years of age) and a grandfather with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the lungs at 45 years of age. When the patient was 13 years old, she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the right distal femur that was successfully treated with surgery. The physical examination shows unilateral left leg edema and erythema that was tender to touch and warm. Homan's sign is positive. During the abdominal examination, you also notice a large mass in the left lower quadrant that is firm and fixed with irregular borders. Proximal leg ultrasonography reveals a non-compressible femoral vein and the presence of a thrombus after color flow Doppler evaluation. Concerned about the association between the palpable mass and a thrombotic event in this patient, you order an abdominal CT scan with contrast that reports a large left abdominopelvic cystic mass with thick septae consistent with ovarian cancer, multiple lymph node involvement, and ascites. Which of the following genes is most likely mutated in this patient?\nA. TP53\nB. BRCA2\nC. MLH1\nD. STK11", "gold_answer": "The gene most likely mutated in this patient is A. TP53. \n\nGiven the patient's personal history of early-onset osteosarcoma, the newly suspected ovarian cancer, and a family history suggestive of various early-onset cancers, these features are characteristic of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is associated with mutations in the TP53 gene, which plays a crucial role in tumor suppression and cell cycle regulation. The combination of her medical history and the presentation aligns with the spectrum of cancers typically associated with this genetic syndrome."}
{"question": "In medical terms, how is a penetrating neck injury defined when assessing trauma patients?", "gold_answer": "In medical terms, a penetrating neck injury is defined as an injury that breaches the platysma muscle in the neck. The platysma acts as a critical boundary layer; if an injury penetrates this thin muscle, it indicates the potential involvement of deeper and vital structures in the neck, such as major blood vessels, nerves, the airway, or the esophagus. As a result, if the platysma is breached, the injury is considered more serious, requiring urgent and thorough evaluation to identify and manage possible life-threatening complications like severe bleeding, nerve damage, or airway obstruction. This definition helps healthcare professionals determine the severity and appropriate treatment approach for neck injuries."}
{"question": "A 35-year-old male patient presents with severe headaches and a tumor located in the infratemporal fossa. He exhibits a loss of general sensation from the anterior two-thirds of his tongue, but his taste and salivation remain unaffected. Which nerve is most likely compromised due to the tumor, given these specific symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms you describe in the patient's condition point towards the involvement of the lingual nerve. The loss of general sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, while maintaining intact taste and salivation functions, suggests that the sensory component of the lingual nerve is compromised. \n\nThe lingual nerve is responsible for general sensation in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. However, taste sensation in this region is mediated by the chorda tympani, a branch of the facial nerve, which appears to be unaffected since the patient's taste is intact. Furthermore, the function of salivation involves other neural pathways that also don't seem impacted here.\n\nTherefore, it is most probable that the tumor in the infratemporal fossa is affecting the lingual nerve, thus leading to the loss of general sensation in this part of the tongue, while leaving taste and salivation functions unaffected."}
{"question": "In a patient presenting with brown spots with a whitish rim, similar lesions on the penis, joint pain, and a history of inconsistent condom use, what genetic risk factor is most commonly associated with the development of this condition?", "gold_answer": "In the clinical scenario described, the genetic risk factor most commonly associated with the development of reactive arthritis, especially considering the history of inconsistent condom use and the symptoms of skin lesions and joint pain, is the HLA-B27 gene. This genetic marker is known to increase susceptibility to reactive arthritis, particularly following certain infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis, which is a possibility in this context."}
{"question": "A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with prominent hypotension and tachycardia. On examination, she has a low central venous pressure and high cardiac output. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F). The physician suspects a bacterial infection with a gram-negative bacterium. Samples are sent to the lab. Meanwhile, high volumes of fluids were given, but the blood pressure did not improve. She was started on noradrenaline. At the biochemical level, a major reaction was induced as part of this patient’s presentation. Of the following vitamins, which one is related to the coenzyme that participates in this induced biochemical reaction?\nA. Vitamin B1 (thiamine)\nB. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)\nC. Vitamin B3 (niacin)\nD. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid)\nE. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxal phosphate)", "gold_answer": "The situation you've described points to septic shock likely induced by a gram-negative bacterial infection, where lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers an inflammatory response. This response is characterized by increased nitric oxide (NO) production, leading to vasodilation and consequent hypotension. The synthesis of NO from L-arginine requires the enzyme nitric oxide synthase, which needs NADPH as a cofactor. NADPH is indeed associated with niacin, which is Vitamin B3. Among the vitamins listed, Vitamin B3 (niacin) is related to the coenzyme NADPH that participates in this biochemical reaction. Thus, the correct answer is C. Vitamin B3 (niacin)."}
{"question": "A 37-year-old woman with a history of multiple urinary tract infections presents with flank pain radiating to the groin, and positive blood on urinary dipstick. Considering her symptoms of left costovertebral tenderness and mild azotemia, what is the most useful initial diagnostic test to perform in this scenario?", "gold_answer": "Given the symptoms of flank pain radiating to the groin, left costovertebral tenderness, and the positive blood on the urine dipstick, these findings are suggestive of a possible kidney stone. In this scenario, the most useful initial diagnostic test to perform is a renal ultrasound. An ultrasound is a safe, non-invasive method that does not involve radiation, and it can identify both the presence of hydronephrosis (which indicates a blockage that could be caused by a stone) and larger stones in the kidney or proximal ureter. If the ultrasound findings are inconclusive or if further evaluation is needed, a non-contrast CT scan may follow. However, starting with a renal ultrasound is prudent to minimize unnecessary exposure and gain important initial insights into her condition."}
{"question": "In a nutritional research study involving a human subject, serum samples were taken at 1 hour and 3 hours after the ingestion of a very fatty meal. These samples showed a decrease in the average diameter of the chylomicrons from 500 nm to 150 nm. Identify the location of the enzyme that is responsible for the reduction in chylomicron size.", "gold_answer": "The enzyme responsible for the reduction in chylomicron size is lipoprotein lipase. This enzyme is located on the endothelial surface of capillaries in tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue. It breaks down triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol, causing the chylomicrons to shrink in size as they circulate in the bloodstream after a meal."}
{"question": "A man presents with hematemesis of approximately 500 ml of blood and upon examination, the spleen is palpable 5 cm below the left costal margin. What is the most likely diagnosis given these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms of significant hematemesis (vomiting blood) and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) suggest the presence of portal hypertension. One of the most common underlying causes of portal hypertension is liver cirrhosis, where scar tissue in the liver obstructs blood flow, leading to increased pressure in the portal venous system. This pressure can cause complications like splenomegaly and esophageal varices, which, when ruptured, result in substantial blood loss, such as the 500 ml of blood the patient vomited. Therefore, given the symptoms presented, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is liver cirrhosis, leading to complications of portal hypertension, including esophageal varices causing the hematemesis."}
{"question": "If each value in a set of observations is multiplied by 10, what is the effect on the standard deviation of the observations?", "gold_answer": "When each value in a set of observations is multiplied by 10, the standard deviation of the observations also becomes 10 times larger. This is because standard deviation is a measure of the spread of data values, and multiplying all data points by a constant factor stretches this spread by that factor as well. Thus, the effect on the standard deviation is to multiply it by 10."}
{"question": "A 56-year-old man named Dinesh is presenting with symptoms including slowness of movements, postural instability, tremors, rigidity, and memory loss. What is the most likely diagnosis based on these clinical features?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms you've described—slowness of movements (bradykinesia), postural instability, tremors, rigidity, and memory loss—it is most likely that Dinesh has Parkinson's disease. These motor symptoms are characteristic of Parkinson's, a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects movement. Over time, Parkinson's can also lead to cognitive issues, such as memory loss, which align with Parkinson's Disease Dementia. This occurs when memory and cognitive impairments develop in the context of existing Parkinson's disease. Given Dinesh's symptoms and age, Parkinson's disease, potentially with associated cognitive decline, is the most probable diagnosis."}
{"question": "When exposing the posterior descending interventricular artery for a coronary bypass procedure due to its nearly total blockage, which accompanying vessel is most susceptible to injury?", "gold_answer": "When exposing the posterior descending artery (PDA) for a coronary bypass procedure, the vessel most susceptible to injury is the middle cardiac vein. This vein runs alongside the PDA in the posterior interventricular sulcus and its proximity makes it vulnerable during surgical procedures on the PDA. Careful handling and precise surgical techniques are required to avoid damaging the middle cardiac vein during such operations."}
{"question": "A 20-year-old female, who has never menstruated, presents with tall stature, long extremities, normal-sized breasts with pale areolas, little axillary and scant pubic hair, and a short blind-ended vaginal pouch on pelvic examination. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?", "gold_answer": "In this scenario, the clinical presentation strongly suggests Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS). Individuals with AIS are genetically male (46,XY) but have a resistance to androgens, leading to the development of predominantly female external characteristics.\n\nGiven the significant risk of gonadal malignancy associated with undescended testes in AIS, the most appropriate next step in management is a bilateral gonadectomy. This procedure involves the removal of the internal testes to eliminate the risk of cancer development while also addressing the hormonal imbalance caused by the retained gonads.\n\nAfter the gonadectomy, you may consider hormone replacement therapy to provide the estrogen needed for maintaining secondary sexual characteristics and bone health."}
{"question": "A 58-year-old male with congestive heart failure and hypertension presents with a new-onset cough and increased serum potassium levels after starting a new medication. Which medication is most likely causing these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms described – a new-onset cough and increased serum potassium levels in a patient with congestive heart failure and hypertension – are most likely caused by an ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibitors are well-known for causing a dry cough as a common side effect due to the accumulation of bradykinin. Additionally, they can lead to hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels) because they inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which affects electrolyte balance. Other medications used in similar situations, like ARBs or aldosterone antagonists, can also cause elevated potassium but are not typically associated with a cough. Therefore, the new medication causing these symptoms is most likely an ACE inhibitor."}
{"question": "A few months after receiving an intramuscular injection, a woman presented with shoulder pain, sensory loss over her shoulders, and mild muscle wasting. Which vaccine did she likely receive that caused these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms the woman is experiencing—shoulder pain, sensory loss, and muscle wasting after an injection—are suggestive of brachial neuritis, also known as Parsonage-Turner syndrome. This condition is known to be associated with vaccinations, particularly those containing tetanus. Therefore, it is likely that she received a vaccine like Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis), which could have triggered these symptoms as a rare complication."}
{"question": "A 25-year-old primigravid woman at 31 weeks' gestation presents with epigastric pain, nausea, and a history of peptic ulcer treatment three years ago. Her laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and proteinuria. What is the physiological mechanism responsible for her symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The physiological mechanism responsible for the symptoms this 25-year-old pregnant woman is experiencing is due to endothelial dysfunction associated with HELLP syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count, which is a severe form of preeclampsia occurring during pregnancy. The endothelial dysfunction leads to widespread microvascular damage, causing disorders such as:\n\n1. **Anemia:** Resulting from microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, where damaged blood vessels destruct red blood cells.\n2. **Thrombocytopenia:** Due to increased platelet consumption as the body tries to cope with the endothelial damage.\n3. **Elevated Liver Enzymes:** Caused by hepatic injury or swelling from vascular injury, possibly stretching the liver capsule, leading to epigastric pain.\n4. **Proteinuria:** Reflecting the kidneys’ impaired function as they leak protein into the urine due to endothelial damage.\n\nTherefore, the systemic endothelial dysfunction is at the heart of these symptoms, facilitating the cascade of events characteristic of HELLP syndrome."}

{"question": "Savita, a 35-year-old female who is Gravida-2 and parity 1+0, is suffering from hepatic encephalopathy. Considering the condition of a pregnant woman, what is the most likely viral cause of her hepatic encephalopathy?", "gold_answer": "Given Savita's condition of hepatic encephalopathy during pregnancy, the most likely viral cause is Hepatitis E. Hepatitis E virus is particularly known for causing severe liver complications in pregnant women, especially in the third trimester, and is associated with increased risks of hepatic encephalopathy and fulminant hepatic failure. This virus is more dangerous during pregnancy compared to other forms of hepatitis, aligning well with Savita's symptoms and condition."}
{"question": "Which gram-negative bacterium has an endotoxin that does not play a role in the pathogenesis of its natural disease?", "gold_answer": "The Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae has an endotoxin that does not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of its natural disease. Instead, the primary driver of disease symptoms in cholera is the cholera toxin, an exotoxin, which leads to the severe diarrhea characteristic of the infection."}
{"question": "What are the three main vertical pillars of trajectories of force arising from the alveolar process and ending in the base of the skull?", "gold_answer": "The three main vertical pillars that describe the trajectories of force arising from the alveolar process and extending to the base of the skull are commonly referred to as:\n\n1. **Canine Pillar**: This pillar starts at the alveolar process around the canine teeth and extends vertically to the base of the skull. It is responsible for transmitting forces from the anterior part of the maxilla.\n\n2. **Zygomatic Pillar**: This pillar runs from the zygomatic arch, contributing to force distribution from the lateral aspects of the face. It passes through the maxilla near the region of the molars and connects to the base of the skull.\n\n3. **Pterygoid or Pterygomaxillary Pillar**: Located posteriorly, this pillar extends from the pterygoid region and helps transmit forces from the rear portion of the maxilla and mandible to the base of the skull.\n\nThese structural pillars are crucial in distributing masticatory forces and maintaining facial skeletal integrity."}
{"question": "The commonest cyanotic hea disease manifesting as congestive cardiac failure during first week of life is -\nA. Pulmonary stenosis\nB. Fallot's tetralogy\nC. Tricuspid atresia\nD. Hypoplastic left hea syndorme", "gold_answer": "The commonest cyanotic heart disease that manifests as congestive cardiac failure during the first week of life is hypoplastic left heart syndrome (D). This condition results in severe underdevelopment of the left side of the heart, and symptoms such as cyanosis and heart failure can become apparent very quickly after birth, especially when the ductus arteriosus closes."}
{"question": "Which cytotoxic drug inhibits the depolymerization of tubulin, leading to the formation of abnormal arrays of microtubules?", "gold_answer": "The cytotoxic drug that inhibits the depolymerization of tubulin, leading to the formation of abnormal arrays of microtubules, is Paclitaxel. Paclitaxel stabilizes microtubules by binding to tubulin, preventing the breakdown of these structures, which is crucial in disrupting cell division. This stabilization leads to the formation of abnormal microtubule arrays, interfering with the proper functioning of cell division, making it a valuable drug in cancer treatment."}
{"question": "After surgery, a patient regains spontaneous breathing with the following parameters: blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, tidal volume of 450 ml, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, inhaled oxygen concentration of 95%, SpO2 of 85%, PaO2 of 54 mmHg, and PaCO2 of 30 mmHg. Considering these values, what is a potential cause of hypoxia that can be ruled out?", "gold_answer": "Given the scenario, we can rule out hypoventilation as a potential cause of hypoxia. The patient is breathing at an increased rate (26 breaths per minute) and with sufficient tidal volume (450 ml), indicating no issue with ventilation. Furthermore, the patient’s low PaCO2 level (30 mmHg) suggests hyperventilation, not hypoventilation. Additionally, with an inhaled oxygen concentration of 95%, a low oxygen environment is not the problem. Therefore, hypoventilation and insufficient environmental oxygen can be confidently ruled out as causes of the patient's hypoxia. Further investigation would focus more on other possibilities like V/Q mismatch or shunt, which could explain the low SpO2 and PaO2 despite high oxygen levels."}

Sequestration dermoid.\nD. Terstomatous dermoid.", "gold_answer": "The correct answer is A. Cock's peculiar tumour. This term refers to a condition that occurs when a sebaceous cyst on the scalp becomes ulcerated, leading to the formation of excessive granulation tissue, which results in a fungating growth."}
{"question": "When testing cord blood cells from an infant suspected of having hemolytic disease of the newborn, what specific laboratory test is commonly performed to confirm the presence of antibodies bound to the infant's red blood cells?", "gold_answer": "The specific laboratory test commonly performed to confirm the presence of antibodies bound to an infant's red blood cells in cases of suspected hemolytic disease of the newborn is the direct Coombs test, also known as the Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT). This test detects antibodies or complement proteins attached to the surface of red blood cells. When performed on a sample of the infant's cord blood, a positive result indicates the presence of these antibodies, confirming the suspicion of hemolytic disease of the newborn."}
{"question": "What is the preferred imaging technique for evaluating a suspected case of Pehe's disease?", "gold_answer": "It seems like there might be some confusion with the name, as \"Pehe's disease\" doesn't appear to match any known medical condition. However, it is possible that you are referring to Peyronie's disease, a condition characterized by the development of fibrous scar tissue inside the penis, causing curved, painful erections.\n\nFor evaluating a suspected case of Peyronie's disease, ultrasound is the preferred imaging technique. It is non-invasive and effective in identifying fibrous plaques and detailing their size and location, which helps in planning treatment and monitoring the progression of the disease. Ultrasound can also assess blood flow within the penis, which is useful in evaluating erectile function."}

{"question": "A 43-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, presents with a 6-month history of heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding. Pelvic examination shows blood and clots in the posterior fornix with normal-appearing internal and external genitalia. An endometrial biopsy reveals straight uniform tubular glands lined with tall pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells with high mitotic activity embedded in an edematous stroma. What enzyme activity is directly responsible for this specific histological appearance of the endometrial biopsy specimen?", "gold_answer": "The specific histological appearance of the endometrial biopsy, characterized by straight uniform tubular glands lined with tall pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells showing high mitotic activity, is indicative of the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. This phase is driven by estrogen, which stimulates the growth and preparation of the endometrium.\n\nThe enzyme directly responsible for the production of estrogen in the ovaries is aromatase. Aromatase converts androgens into estrogens, resulting in the elevated estrogen levels that drive the endometrial changes observed in this biopsy. Therefore, the enzyme activity directly responsible for the histological features present in this biopsy specimen is aromatase."}
{"question": "In a hemodynamically stable patient who has experienced abdominal trauma, which diagnostic investigation is preferred to initially assess internal injuries?", "gold_answer": "In a hemodynamically stable patient who has experienced abdominal trauma, the preferred initial diagnostic investigation is typically a FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) exam. This non-invasive and quick ultrasound procedure allows healthcare providers to rapidly assess for the presence of free fluid, which may indicate internal bleeding, and helps guide further management decisions. If more detailed information is needed based on the results or clinical judgment, a CT scan often follows to provide a comprehensive assessment of potential internal injuries."}

{"question": "A 39-year-old man experiences difficulty hearing high-pitched sounds like the beeping of a microwave or birds chirping, but has no problem hearing low-pitched sounds such as a pipe organ. He works as an aircraft marshaller. A Rinne test indicates air conduction greater than bone conduction bilaterally, and a Weber test does not lateralize. What is the most likely underlying cause of his hearing loss?", "gold_answer": "The most likely underlying cause of this man's hearing loss is noise-induced hearing loss due to his job as an aircraft marshaller. His role exposes him to high levels of noise, particularly from jet engines, which predominantly affects the outer hair cells in the cochlea responsible for detecting high-frequency sounds. The Rinne and Weber test results suggest a sensorineural type of hearing loss, which aligns with the symptoms and occupational exposure to loud noises. This type of hearing loss commonly causes difficulty hearing high-pitched sounds while preserving the ability to hear lower-pitched sounds."}

What is the most appropriate immediate step in managing this chemical eye injury?", "gold_answer": "The most appropriate immediate step in managing a chemical eye injury from battery acid exposure is to immediately irrigate the affected eye. Begin flushing the eye with copious amounts of water or saline solution as quickly as possible. This step is critical to dilute and remove the acidic substance from the eye, minimizing the potential for severe damage. It's important to continue flushing for at least 15 to 30 minutes, ensuring the eyelids are held open and rolled to allow thorough cleansing of all affected areas. This immediate irrigation is vital in reducing the risk of long-term injury, and should be performed urgently before any other treatment considerations."}
{"question": "Considering the various forms of the human hemoglobin gene, which specific aspect of a protein is most critical to preserve in order to maintain its functional capability?", "gold_answer": "The most critical aspect of a protein to preserve in order to maintain its functional capability, particularly for hemoglobin, is the primary structure, which is the specific sequence of amino acids. This sequence is crucial because it dictates how the protein folds into its unique three-dimensional shapes, the tertiary and quaternary structures, which are essential for its function. \n\nIn hemoglobin, specific amino acids around the heme group create an environment necessary for effective oxygen binding. Even a single mutation in the primary structure can disrupt this environment, as seen in sickle-cell anemia, underscoring the importance of preserving the exact amino acid sequence for maintaining hemoglobin's proper function. Therefore, ensuring the integrity of the primary structure is vital for sustaining the functional capability of hemoglobin."}
{"question": "What condition is characterized by acute abdominal pain, blood and mucus in the stool, and a palpable abdominal mass in a patient?", "gold_answer": "The condition characterized by acute abdominal pain, blood and mucus in the stool, and a palpable abdominal mass is most likely intussusception. Intussusception occurs when a part of the intestine telescopes into an adjacent segment, leading to obstruction. This can cause the symptoms described, including the passage of stools that are often referred to as 'currant jelly stools' due to the presence of blood and mucus. The palpable mass, sometimes described as 'sausage-shaped,' is another classic feature of this condition. This is a significant and urgent medical issue that requires prompt evaluation and management, often necessitating radiologic intervention or surgery."}
{"question": "What type of contraceptive is recommended for a 30-year-old woman on warfarin for deep vein thrombosis?", "gold_answer": "For a 30-year-old woman on warfarin for deep vein thrombosis, it's important to choose a contraceptive method that doesn't increase the risk of blood clots and doesn't interfere with warfarin's anticoagulant effects. Given these considerations, the use of hormonal contraceptives with estrogen, such as combined oral contraceptives, should be avoided, as they can increase clotting risks.\n\nProgestin-only options are a safer choice in this scenario. These include the progestin-only pill (also known as the mini-pill), the contraceptive injection (Depo-Provera), and the contraceptive implant (Nexplanon). These options do not contain estrogen and, therefore, do not heighten the risk of thrombotic events.\n\nAdditionally, non-hormonal methods such as the copper intrauterine device (IUD) or barrier methods like condoms are good alternatives, as they do not interfere with warfarin therapy or increase bleeding risk.\n\nUltimately, it's essential for the individual to consult with their healthcare provider to determine the most suitable method based on their specific medical history and lifestyle."}
{"question": "In the context of orthodontic wires, when the width of the wire is greater than its height, what mode does the wire belong to?", "gold_answer": "In the context of orthodontic wires, when the width of the wire is greater than its height, the wire is considered to be in the \"edgewise\" mode. This means that the broader side of the wire is used to enhance control over tooth movement, even though logically, one might think of the orientation as \"flatwise\" given its wider appearance. In practice, the edgewise mode takes advantage of the larger width for effective orthodontic treatment."}
{"question": "In which condition is a CT scan of the head not required before performing a lumbar puncture?", "gold_answer": "A CT scan of the head is not required before performing a lumbar puncture in cases where the patient does not exhibit any signs of increased intracranial pressure or other concerning neurological symptoms. Specifically, if the patient is awake, alert, and is not presenting with altered mental status, focal neurological deficits, new onset seizures, signs of papilledema, or is immunocompetent, it is generally considered safe to proceed with the lumbar puncture without a prior CT scan. This approach is often guided by clinical judgment and aligns with established protocols, particularly in situations like suspected meningitis where timely diagnosis and treatment are critical."}

{"question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with recurrent right upper quadrant abdominal pain, increasing over the past 2 months. She has been using oral contraceptive pills for the last 2 years, and physical examination reveals hepatomegaly. Ultrasound shows a predominantly hypoechoic mass in segment VI of the liver. Considering these clinical findings and imaging results, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a hepatocellular adenoma. The patient's use of oral contraceptive pills is a known risk factor for the development of this type of liver tumor. The predominantly hypoechoic mass observed on the ultrasound further supports this diagnosis, as hepatocellular adenomas can present with such characteristics."}
{"question": "In a 65-year-old smoker presenting with hoarseness, hemoptysis, and a hard painless lump in the left supraclavicular fossa, what is the most appropriate diagnostic step to take?", "gold_answer": "In the case of a 65-year-old smoker with symptoms of hoarseness, hemoptysis, and a hard, painless lump in the left supraclavicular fossa, the most appropriate diagnostic step is to perform a fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the lump. This approach allows for direct evaluation of the lymph node, which could provide immediate and specific information about the presence of metastasis or other pathological processes, especially in the context of a possible malignancy such as lung cancer. FNAB is a minimally invasive procedure and can guide subsequent management and diagnostic steps by clarifying the nature of the lymphadenopathy."}
{"question": "In a situation where a doctor must perform an urgent operation on an unconscious patient to save their life, and no relatives are available to provide consent, what ethical principle allows the doctor to proceed without obtaining consent?", "gold_answer": "In situations where a doctor needs to perform urgent surgery on an unconscious patient and no relatives are available to provide consent, the ethical principle of implied consent allows the doctor to proceed without obtaining explicit consent. This principle assumes that a reasonable person would consent to treatment if it is necessary to save their life or prevent serious harm. Alongside implied consent, the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence also guide the doctor to act in the patient's best interest, prioritizing actions that preserve life and minimize harm."}
{"question": "What are the treatment modalities for myopia that include both surgical incisions and LASER procedures?", "gold_answer": "The treatment modalities for myopia that involve both surgical incisions and laser procedures include:\n\n1. **LASIK (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis):** This is the most well-known procedure where a flap is created on the cornea using a microkeratome (a precise surgical blade) or a femtosecond laser. After the flap is lifted, an excimer laser is used to reshape the cornea to correct myopia. \n\n2. **LASEK (Laser-Assisted Sub-Epithelial Keratomileusis):** Similar to LASIK, this method involves creating a flap, but here it's a thinner epithelial flap. It can be created through chemical means or mechanically. Afterward, an excimer laser reshapes the cornea. \n\n3. **SMILE (Small Incision Lenticule Extraction):** This is a more recent and less invasive procedure. In SMILE, a femtosecond laser creates a small lenticule inside the cornea. A small incision is then made to extract the lenticule, thus altering the shape of the cornea and correcting the myopia.\n\nEach of these procedures combines the precision of lasers with some form of surgical incision to alter the corneal structure, improving vision for individuals with myopia."}
{"question": "Given that a PCR reaction using Taq polymerase only amplified the genomic material from one of the following viruses – Poliovirus, Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, and Yellow Fever virus – which virus's genomic material was successfully amplified, and why?", "gold_answer": "The genomic material that was successfully amplified by Taq polymerase in the PCR reaction is that of Adenovirus. This outcome is due to the fact that Adenovirus has a DNA genome, which is necessary for Taq polymerase to function effectively. Taq polymerase is an enzyme used in PCR to synthesize new strands of DNA complementary to the target DNA sequence; it cannot use RNA as a template. Since Poliovirus, Rhinovirus, and Yellow Fever virus all have RNA genomes, their genetic material would require an additional step of reverse transcription (converting RNA to DNA) before PCR amplification could occur. Consequently, Adenovirus, with its DNA genome, is the only virus in the list whose genomic material could be directly amplified by Taq polymerase in a PCR reaction."}
{"question": "A 6 year old female child presented with a valgus deformity of right elbow since 2 years which is gradually progressive and she is feeling tingling in ulnar one and half fingers as well. She had a history of cast applied for 6 weeks after fall on outstretched hand 2 years back. The probable fracture was:\nA. Supracondylar humerus fracture\nB. Posterior dislocation of elbow\nC. Lateral condyle humerus fracture\nD. Fracture medial condyle humerus", "gold_answer": "C. Lateral condyle humerus fracture. \n\nIn this scenario, the 6-year-old girl's valgus deformity of the elbow and ulnar nerve symptoms point towards a lateral condyle humerus fracture. Such fractures, if not properly healed, can lead to a cubitus valgus deformity, which aligns with the symptoms observed. The tingling sensation in the ulnar distribution indicates possible ulnar nerve involvement, often seen with this type of deformity due to stretching of the nerve. The history of cast placement following a fall on an outstretched hand further supports this deduction."}
{"question": "A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of involuntary leakage of urine for the past 4 months, which she has experienced when bicycling to work and when laughing.

Obturator nerve\nD. S3–S4 nerve roots", "gold_answer": "The muscles most likely affected by this patient's condition, which is consistent with stress urinary incontinence, receive efferent innervation from the S3-S4 nerve roots. These nerve roots supply the pelvic floor muscles, including the levator ani, which are crucial for maintaining continence and preventing involuntary urine leakage during activities such as laughing and cycling. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. S3–S4 nerve roots"}
{"question": "A 10-year-old boy with asthma, who was previously well-controlled using only a Ventolin inhaler, is now experiencing increased symptoms like nightly awakenings and significant limitations in physical activity, requiring daily inhaler use. His pediatrician adds an inhaled combination of formoterol and budesonide to his regimen. During spirometry, what peak expiratory flow rate is most likely to be observed in this patient given his current condition?", "gold_answer": "Given the boy's symptoms of increased nighttime awakenings and limitations during physical activity, it is clear that his asthma is not well-controlled. These symptoms suggest a progression to at least moderate asthma, which typically corresponds to a decrease in lung function as measured by spirometry. \n\nFor a 10-year-old child experiencing uncontrolled asthma, the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is likely reduced. Based on his condition, the PEFR can be expected to be around 60-80% of the predicted normal value for his age and height. This decline reflects the restricted airflow resulting from his worsening asthma symptoms."}
{"question": "A young man has sustained a stab injury in the left 5th intercostal space at the mid-clavicular line. On examination, there is no tracheal deviation, heart sounds are diminished, his systolic blood pressure is 80 mmHg, and his respiratory rate is 20/min. Based on these clinical findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical findings you've described, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac tamponade. In this scenario, the stab wound's location is significant, as it closely aligns with the position of the heart, likely affecting the pericardium—the sac surrounding the heart. The diminished heart sounds, low blood pressure, and absence of tracheal deviation further support this diagnosis. Cardiac tamponade occurs when fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, restricting the heart's ability to adequately fill and pump, leading to muffled heart sounds and hypotension. This condition is a medical emergency that requires prompt attention to relieve the pressure on the heart and restore normal function."}
{"question": "Identify the TCA cycle intermediate that is least likely to be directly involved or altered by other metabolic pathways.", "gold_answer": "In the citric acid (TCA) cycle, each intermediate can have roles outside of the cycle, interacting with various metabolic pathways. However, succinate, one of the intermediates, primarily carries out its function within the TCA cycle and participates in the electron transport chain via succinate dehydrogenase. Unlike other intermediates such as citrate, α-ketoglutarate, and oxaloacetate, which actively participate in pathways like fatty acid synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and gluconeogenesis, succinate remains relatively focused on its task of converting to fumarate and contributing to cellular respiration. Therefore, succinate is the intermediate least likely to be directly involved in or altered by other metabolic pathways outside of the TCA cycle."}
{"question": "Based on prognostic criteria used to predict the severity of a condition in a 55-year-old male with gallstones, severe abdominal pain, elevated serum lipase, and periumbilical ecchymosis, identify which serum marker is not typically used in this assessment.", "gold_answer": "In the context of evaluating the severity of acute pancreatitis using prognostic criteria like Ranson's criteria or the APACHE II score, serum lipase is indeed used for diagnosis but not typically included in these severity assessments. Another serum marker that is generally not mentioned in these scoring systems is gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). GGT is more associated with assessing liver and bile duct conditions rather than gauging the severity of acute pancreatitis. Therefore, among the possible serum markers considered, GGT is not typically used in assessing the severity of this condition with these criteria."}
{"question": "In a child recently diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, what is considered a poor prognostic indicator?", "gold_answer": "A poor prognostic indicator in a child recently diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) includes several factors:\n\n1. **Age:** Children who are less than 1 year old or older than 10 years at the time of diagnosis generally have a poorer prognosis.\n\n2. **White Blood Cell Count:** A high leukocyte count, typically over 50,000 per microliter at diagnosis, is associated with a less favorable outcome.\n\n3. **Genetic Abnormalities:** Certain genetic markers, especially the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (t(9;22) translocation), indicate a worse prognosis.\n\n4. **Response to Treatment:** A slow response to initial therapy, particularly failure to achieve remission within the first four weeks of treatment, is concerning for a poor prognosis.\n\nThese factors, among others, help medical professionals assess the likely course of the disease and tailor treatment plans accordingly."}
{"question": "In a study examining the association between smoking and lung cancer among 1,000 smokers aged 20-30 over five years, researchers concluded no relationship exists. What aspect of study design is most likely responsible for this conclusion?", "gold_answer": "The most likely aspect of the study design responsible for the conclusion that there is no relationship between smoking and lung cancer is the short follow-up period combined with the young age of the participants. Lung cancer generally develops over a long period, often requiring decades of exposure to risk factors, such as smoking. By focusing on individuals aged 20-30 over just five years, the study may not have allowed enough time for lung cancer to develop and be detected. Therefore, the timing and the age group selected are insufficient to reveal a potential link between smoking and the onset of lung cancer."}
{"question": "A 26-year-old G1P0 woman, who has been diagnosed with gestational diabetes and admits to poor glucose control and non-adherence to insulin therapy, delivers a baby with an asymmetric, enlarged interventricular septum, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and significantly reduced ejection fraction. What is the most appropriate step in managing this newborn's condition after delivery?", "gold_answer": "Given the situation of the newborn having asymmetric septal hypertrophy leading to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, the immediate management focus is to address the obstruction and support the heart's pumping ability. This condition reflects a complication related to the mother's poorly controlled gestational diabetes, and it poses a significant risk if not managed promptly.\n\nIn such cases, relieving the dynamic obstruction in the outflow tract is crucial. A common and effective approach involves the use of beta-blockers. Propranolol, in particular, can help reduce the obstruction by slowing down the heart rate and decreasing the contractile force, thereby reducing the pressure gradient across the obstruction. This can improve blood flow and cardiac function.\n\nWhile it is also important to monitor and stabilize the newborn's blood sugar levels due to the potential risk of hypoglycemia, the primary concern is to address the cardiac issue immediately. Thus, initiating treatment with propranolol to manage the obstruction and support heart function would be the most appropriate first step in managing this newborn's condition after delivery."}
{"question": "A young boy presents with multiple flaccid bullous lesions over the trunk accompanied by some oral mucosal lesions. What specific finding would you expect to observe on an immunofluorescence study of a biopsy specimen from this patient?", "gold_answer": "In a case like this, with flaccid bullous lesions on the skin and oral mucosa involvement, the condition likely is pemphigus vulgaris. On an immunofluorescence study of a biopsy specimen from a patient with pemphigus vulgaris, you would expect to see a characteristic finding: intercellular deposition of IgG and C3 in a \"fishnet\" or \"chicken-wire\" pattern in the epidermis. This pattern occurs because the autoantibodies are targeting desmogleins, components of the desmosomes that hold skin cells together, leading to the loss of cell adhesion and blister formation."}
{"question": "Which organism is commonly used as a bacteriology indicator of water pollution due to its easy culture methods?", "gold_answer": "Escherichia coli, or E. coli, is commonly used as an indicator of water pollution. It is preferred due to its easy culture methods and its presence in the intestines of warm-blooded animals, which makes it a reliable marker for fecal contamination in water."}
{"question": "Based on the family history and biopsy results provided, what cellular event is most likely affected by a genetic mutation in the underlying cause of this 34-year-old woman's invasive ductal carcinoma?", "gold_answer": "Based on the situation described, the most likely cellular event affected by a genetic mutation is the DNA repair process, specifically through homologous recombination. In the context of breast cancer, particularly in a younger individual like this 34-year-old woman, mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are common culprits. These genes play a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. A mutation that impairs the function of these genes leads to dysfunctional DNA repair mechanisms, increasing the risk of developing cancer due to accumulation of genetic errors."}
{"question": "Kamla, a 30-year-old P2L2 woman with a fibroid measuring 3.2 x 4.1 cm, has been experiencing menorrhagia and undergoing symptomatic treatment for six months. Despite her condition, she has declined surgical options. What is the next line of non-surgical management to consider for her?", "gold_answer": "Given Kamla's situation—30 years old, with menorrhagia due to a fibroid and a preference against surgical intervention—the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) emerges as a highly suitable option for non-surgical management. This IUD can effectively reduce menstrual bleeding while also providing contraception, which might be seen as an added benefit since Kamla has completed her family. It addresses her symptoms without the systemic side effects associated with other hormonal treatments, such as GnRH analogs, making it an appealing choice for a sustainable and non-invasive solution."}
{"question": "A 35-year-old athlete presents with a long diastolic murmur heard over the right 2nd intercostal space during chest auscultation, along with a blood pressure reading of 148/64 mm Hg. Based on these clinical findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the provided clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis is aortic regurgitation. The presence of a long diastolic murmur heard over the right 2nd intercostal space typically indicates an issue with the aortic valve. The accompanying blood pressure reading of 148/64 mm Hg, which reveals a wide pulse pressure, further supports this diagnosis. This wide pulse pressure occurs because aortic regurgitation leads to increased stroke volume and elevated systolic pressure, while the diastolic pressure is reduced due to the backflow of blood into the left ventricle during diastole. These findings align well with the typical presentation of aortic regurgitation."}
{"question": "In a 2-year-old child presenting with scattered lesions in the skull, where a biopsy reveals Langerhans giant cells, what is the most commonly associated immunohistochemical marker with this condition?", "gold_answer": "In the scenario described, where a 2-year-old child presents with scattered skull lesions and a biopsy reveals Langerhans giant cells, the most commonly associated immunohistochemical marker with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) is CD1a. This marker is routinely used to identify the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a hallmark of this condition."}
{"question": "A 30-year-old male is having Attic cholesteatoma of left ear with lateral sinus thrombophlebitis. Which of the following will be the operation of choice\nA. Intact canal wall mastoidectomy\nB. Mastoidectomy with cavity obliteration\nC. Simple mastoidectomy with Tympanoplasty\nD. Canal wall down mastoidectomy", "gold_answer": "For a patient with an attic cholesteatoma of the left ear and lateral sinus thrombophlebitis, the operation of choice would be a canal wall down mastoidectomy. This procedure involves removing the posterior and superior canal walls, which allows for extensive access to eradicate the disease fully and ensures proper drainage. This is particularly important in complex cases like this, where both the cholesteatoma and sinus thrombophlebitis need to be addressed comprehensively. Thus, option D, canal wall down mastoidectomy, is the appropriate choice."}
{"question": "A 72-year-old man with a history of hypertension and obesity presents for a general checkup with a new cardiac murmur detected after S2 over the left sternal border. His blood pressure is elevated at 177/108 mmHg. Considering these findings, what other auscultatory feature might be present in this patient, indicative of the most likely underlying vascular condition?", "gold_answer": "Given the clinical context of a 72-year-old man with a history of hypertension, obesity, and a newly detected diastolic murmur over the left sternal border, aortic regurgitation is a likely consideration. The elevated blood pressure, especially with a wide pulse pressure, further supports this possibility.\n\nIn cases of significant aortic regurgitation, certain additional auscultatory features might be present. One notable feature is Duroziez's sign, which is characterized by a diastolic murmur heard over a peripheral artery, such as the femoral artery. This occurs due to the high stroke volume and wide pulse pressure associated with significant aortic regurgitation. Therefore, Duroziez's sign may be an additional auscultatory feature indicative of the underlying vascular condition in this patient."}
{"question": "When individuals are divided into distinct groups, and random samples are taken from each group, what is this method of sampling called?", "gold_answer": "This method of sampling is called stratified sampling. In stratified sampling, the population is divided into distinct groups, known as strata, based on specific characteristics. Then, random samples are drawn from each stratum, ensuring representation from all parts of the population. This approach helps to improve the precision of the sample by capturing the variability within each group, leading to more accurate and reliable results."}
{"question": "A 65-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of dizziness, fatigue, and shortness of breath, alongside a 3-month history of increased straining with bowel movements and decreased caliber of stools. He is pale, with mild tachycardia, conjunctival pallor, occult blood-positive stool, hemoglobin concentration of 6.4 g/dL, and mean corpuscular volume of 74 μm3. Considering these findings, what is the most likely finding on a double-contrast barium enema study?", "gold_answer": "The findings of the case—a 65-year-old man with symptoms and lab results indicating microcytic anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding—strongly suggest the possibility of colorectal cancer. This would be consistent with his age and the changes in bowel habits being described. Given these considerations, the most likely finding on a double-contrast barium enema study would be the presence of an \"apple core\" lesion. This appearance is characteristic of a stenosing carcinoma in the colon, where the growth causes a constriction that visually resembles the central core of an apple."}
{"question": "A 38-year-old man presents with chest discomfort, progressive dyspnea, and cannot perform daily chores without breathlessness. He has an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by progressive proximal muscle weakness and gait abnormalities. Physical examination shows a waddling gait, weak patellar reflexes, holosystolic murmur, displaced point of maximal impulse, and bilateral pitting edema. Laboratory studies reveal elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels. What is the most likely underlying molecular cause of this patient's muscle weakness?", "gold_answer": "The most likely underlying molecular cause of this patient's muscle weakness is a deficiency of dystrophin protein. This is due to mutations in the dystrophin gene, which are characteristic of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, an X-linked recessive disorder. The absence or severe reduction of the dystrophin protein leads to the progressive muscle weakness and cardiac issues observed in this patient."}
{"question": "Given that a 35-year-old man from Shimoga, Karnataka, presents with sudden onset of fever, headache, myalgia, conjunctivitis, and skin bleeds after visiting a forest with a high population of monkeys, identify the vector responsible for the disease he is likely suffering from.", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms presented and the context of the man's visit to a forest in Shimoga, Karnataka, it is likely that he is suffering from Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD). The vector responsible for transmitting Kyasanur Forest Disease is the Haemaphysalis spinigera tick."}
{"question": "A 30-year-old man recently began taking TMP-SMX for a urinary tract infection and now presents with a new rash. His vital signs are stable, but a physical examination shows desquamative skin covering both lower extremities. Considering these symptoms and his medication, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the details provided, the most likely diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). Stevens-Johnson syndrome can occur as a severe adverse reaction to certain medications, including TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). The presence of desquamation, or skin peeling, particularly on the lower extremities, aligns with the skin manifestations associated with SJS. The timing of the rash development shortly after starting on TMP-SMX also supports this diagnosis. SJS typically involves less than 10% of the body surface area with skin lesions, which fits the description provided. It is crucial to address this reaction promptly as SJS can progress and become life-threatening. Discontinuation of the offending drug and immediate medical intervention are necessary."}
{"question": "A 23-year-old woman with no gynecologic complaints or systemic diseases, who is sexually active and uses oral contraceptive pills, has a Pap smear result that is satisfactory for evaluation and negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancy, but it notes an absent transformation zone component. Considering that she has no risk factors and a normal physical examination, including a normal cervix, how should her cervical cancer screening proceed according to guidelines?", "gold_answer": "Based on the guidelines for cervical cancer screening, given that the 23-year-old woman has had a Pap smear result that's satisfactory for evaluation and negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancy, she does not need immediate follow-up despite the absence of the transformation zone component. The absence of the transformation zone is not uncommon, particularly in younger women or those using oral contraceptives, and doesn't by itself require earlier or additional testing unless there are other risk factors.\n\nHer age places her within the 21-29 age group, for which the general recommendation is a Pap smear every three years if results are normal. Since she has no additional risk factors and her current physical examination, including the cervix, is normal, she should continue with routine screening. Therefore, she should follow the standard screening guidelines and return for her next Pap smear in three years."}
{"question": "A 44-year-old man comes to the emergency department experiencing persistent palpitations after heavy alcohol consumption at a wedding. Despite initial irregularly irregular pulse and absence of P waves on an ECG, a subsequent ECG one hour later shows normal P waves with narrow QRS complexes, although he still has occasional palpitations. With normal echocardiography results and no chronic health issues, what is the most appropriate next step in his management?", "gold_answer": "Given the scenario, it is likely that the 44-year-old man experienced a transient episode of atrial fibrillation, commonly associated with acute excessive alcohol consumption, termed 'holiday heart syndrome.' Since his heart rhythm spontaneously reverted to normal, and his echocardiogram shows no structural abnormalities, the best course of action is conservative management.\n\nThe most appropriate next step is to reassure the patient and offer counseling on reducing alcohol intake to prevent future episodes. It's important to educate him about the potential risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption, particularly its impact on heart rhythm, and discuss lifestyle modifications that could help prevent recurrence of symptoms. Continued observation is recommended, and if the palpitations persist or become more troubling, further evaluation or consideration of medication, such as a beta-blocker, might be warranted. However, at this point, lifestyle modification and monitoring are sufficient."}

{"question": "What is the mature defense mechanism called that involves postponing paying attention to a conscious impulse or conflict?", "gold_answer": "The mature defense mechanism that involves postponing attention to a conscious impulse or conflict is called suppression. Suppression is a conscious decision to temporarily set aside thoughts or emotions until a more suitable time, allowing an individual to manage their current situation without becoming overwhelmed. This ability to delay processing emotions or impulses consciously is what characterizes suppression as a mature defense mechanism."}
{"question": "In a newborn infant born at 42 weeks gestation with a complication of shoulder dystocia during delivery, and whose right arm is adducted, internally rotated at the shoulder, and extended at the elbow, which muscle would most likely retain normal strength, given that flexion and extension of the wrist and digits are intact?", "gold_answer": "In this newborn, the clinical scenario described is consistent with Erb's palsy, which typically affects the C5 and C6 nerve roots due to shoulder dystocia during delivery. The characteristic arm posture you mentioned—down by the side, turned inward (internally rotated), and with the elbow extended—is due to weakness in muscles like the deltoid and the biceps that are innervated by these nerves.\n\nSince the infant can move their wrist and fingers normally, this suggests that the lower parts of the brachial plexus (C8 and T1) are functioning well, which supports movements such as gripping and wrist extension.\n\nGiven your information, the muscle that is most likely to retain normal strength is the triceps brachii. This muscle is primarily innervated by the C7 nerve root, which is typically unaffected in a classic Erb's palsy. Therefore, functions like extending the elbow, which the triceps brachii facilitates, should be normal."}
{"question": "What is the likely diagnosis for a 60-year-old male who presents with foul breath, regurgitation of food eaten 3 days ago, and a gurgling sound on swallowing?", "gold_answer": "The likely diagnosis for the 60-year-old male with these symptoms is Zenker's diverticulum. This condition involves the formation of a pouch in the esophagus where food can accumulate, leading to foul breath, regurgitation of food days after consumption, and a gurgling sound on swallowing. These symptoms align well with Zenker's diverticulum, making it a plausible diagnosis."}

{"question": "What is the recommended time for impression material to set into a rubbery or rigid solid in the mouth for accurate replica production of intra and extraoral tissues?", "gold_answer": "The recommended setting times for dental impression materials vary depending on the type of material used. For accurate replica production of intraoral and extraoral tissues, here are the general guidelines:\n\n1. **Alginate**: This material typically sets within 2 to 4 minutes. It is favored for its quick setting time, which can be beneficial for procedures that prioritize speed, though it might offer less precision than other materials.\n\n2. **Polyvinyl Siloxane (PVS)**: Known for its precision and dimensional stability, PVS usually sets in about 4 to 6 minutes. Some formulations include a fast-set option that can reduce the time to approximately 2 minutes, which can be useful in certain clinical situations.\n\n3. **Polyether**: This material features excellent detail reproduction and wettability, generally setting around 4 to 6 minutes. It provides a balance between setting time and precision.\n\nWhile these are the typical setting times for each material, it’s essential to follow the specific manufacturer’s recommendations for optimal results, as they may vary slightly based on the brand and formulation. Additionally, considerations like environmental conditions—including temperature and humidity—and specific clinical scenarios might influence the choice of material and its setting time. In some specialized cases, a longer setting time, such as 7 minutes, might be recommended for specific advanced formulations or intricate procedures. Always consult the latest clinical guidelines and studies for the most accurate and applicable information."}
{"question": "In a serial extraction procedure, if the maxillary first premolar is extracted, in which direction does the maxillary canine erupt?", "gold_answer": "In a serial extraction procedure, when the maxillary first premolar is extracted, the goal is to create space for the properly aligned eruption of the maxillary canine. Typically, the maxillary canine, given this additional space, will erupt in a more favorable position along the dental arch, generally moving downward (occlusally) and mesially into the space created, aligning itself better with the adjacent teeth. This results in a more harmonious dental alignment, minimizing the chances of labial or palatal misalignment."}
{"question": "An 8-month-old baby is brought to the emergency room with a history of poor feeding and generalized weakness after being fed honey. Identify the mechanism by which the toxin responsible for these symptoms affects the body.", "gold_answer": "The symptoms of poor feeding and generalized weakness in the 8-month-old baby are likely due to infant botulism, which is linked to the ingestion of honey. Honey can contain spores of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. In infants, these spores can germinate in the intestines and produce botulinum toxin, a neurotoxin.\n\nThe mechanism by which botulinum toxin affects the body involves its interference with nerve function. Specifically, the toxin cleaves SNARE proteins, which are essential for the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the nerve terminal membrane. This process is crucial for the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. When the SNARE proteins are disrupted, acetylcholine cannot be released, leading to a failure in muscle contraction. This results in the muscle weakness and poor feeding observed in the baby."}
{"question": "A 63-year-old man presents with a 3-month history of fatigue and constipation, along with dull left midback pain unresponsive to ibuprofen. His laboratory studies reveal hypercalcemia and the presence of protein and blood in urine. Physical examination shows a left-sided varicocele present in both supine and standing positions and a symmetrically enlarged prostate. Given these findings, what is the most appropriate next step in his management?", "gold_answer": "Given the clinical presentation, including fatigue, constipation, hypercalcemia, hematuria, proteinuria, persistent left-sided varicocele, and back pain, these findings raise a significant suspicion for a renal mass, potentially renal cell carcinoma. The hypercalcemia could be associated with paraneoplastic syndrome, and the left-sided varicocele that does not reduce when supine might indicate a mass effect on the left renal vein. A CT scan of the abdomen would provide valuable information to determine if there is a renal mass causing these symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in his management is to obtain a CT scan of the abdomen. This imaging study will help to identify or rule out the presence of a renal mass, confirm the underlying cause of the symptoms, and guide further diagnostic and therapeutic decisions."}
{"question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to her primary care clinic for a general checkup. She states she's been a bit more fatigued lately during finals season but is otherwise well.

{"question": "How is Mycobacterium tuberculosis classified when it shows resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide?", "gold_answer": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis that shows resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide is classified as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The key classification factor for MDR-TB is resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin, which are the primary drugs used in treatment. Resistance to pyrazinamide does not change the classification but can complicate treatment options."}
{"question": "Given a patient with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome who presents with shortness of breath, chest tightness, cyanosis, a blood gas analysis showing pH 7.30, PaO2 55 mmHg, and PaCO2 70 mmHg, explain which aspect of the patient's condition is incorrectly assessed if classified as ventilatory exchange dysfunction.", "gold_answer": "In this case, classifying the patient's condition as ventilatory exchange dysfunction does not fully capture the underlying issue. The primary problem appears to be hypoventilation due to respiratory muscle weakness caused by Guillain-Barré syndrome. This muscle weakness leads to inadequate ventilation, resulting in the retention of carbon dioxide (evidenced by the elevated PaCO2) and insufficient oxygenation (indicated by the low PaO2).\n\nThe high PaCO2 and acidemia (low pH) strongly suggest respiratory acidosis, which typically occurs due to inadequate ventilation rather than a specific issue with gas exchange at the alveolar level. Therefore, the primary factor affecting the patient’s respiratory status is likely the inability to ventilate effectively because of muscle weakness, not a direct dysfunction in the exchange of gases. Recognizing this distinction is critical for addressing the root cause, which is neuromuscular in nature rather than a primary pulmonary exchange problem."}
{"question": "What immunizations should a completely unimmunized 3-year-old child receive at their first visit to an immunization clinic at a Primary Health Center (PHC)?", "gold_answer": "A completely unimmunized 3-year-old should receive several key vaccines at their first visit to an immunization clinic, focusing on providing immediate protection against serious diseases. The vaccines that are typically prioritized include:\n\n1. **DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis)**\n2. **IPV (Inactivated Polio Vaccine)**\n3. **MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella)**\n4. **Varicella (Chickenpox)**\n5. **Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b)**\n6. **Hepatitis B**\n7. **Pneumococcal Vaccine (PCV)**\n\nThe exact schedule and combination might vary based on the availability of combined vaccines, regional immunization guidelines, and the clinic's protocols. Combination vaccines can simplify the process by reducing the number of shots needed.\n\nAdditionally, in some regions, Vitamin A supplements might be offered if there is a concern about deficiencies. This is often done simultaneously with immunization to enhance overall child health.\n\nAfter this initial visit, the child will need to follow a catch-up schedule to complete all remaining doses for optimal protection. It’s crucial to coordinate with healthcare providers to ensure the child completes their immunization series in a timely manner."}

{"question": "A 75-year-old man presents with signs of worsening heart failure and is noted to have a history that includes myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and more. With his symptoms and clinical findings such as jugular venous distention, pitting edema, and lung crackles, what electrolyte imbalance would be most strongly associated with an increased risk of mortality in this patient?", "gold_answer": "In the context of worsening heart failure, hyponatremia, which is an electrolyte imbalance characterized by low sodium levels in the blood, is most strongly associated with an increased risk of mortality. In patients with heart failure, hyponatremia often indicates severe disease and poorer prognosis. It's indicative of the body's inability to handle excess fluid, a common issue in heart failure, and is a critical factor to monitor closely in such patients."}
{"question": "A patient living with HIV (PLHA) presented with a headache and blurring of vision for the past 15 days. Upon examination, neck rigidity was noted, and the patient's CD4 count is below 100. An MRI scan was performed. Based on these clinical findings, what is the diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms described—headache, blurred vision, neck rigidity, and a CD4 count below 100 in a patient living with HIV—the clinical picture is highly suggestive of Cryptococcal meningitis. This condition is an opportunistic fungal infection common in individuals with severely compromised immune systems, particularly those with a very low CD4 count. The symptoms such as headaches and neck stiffness align with meningitis, and the blurred vision may result from increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this scenario is Cryptococcal meningitis."}
{"question": "A 2-week-old newborn with worsening feeding difficulties and specific cardiac murmurs is found to have blood shunting through the ventricular septum during systole and undergoes surgery to repair this defect. What changes are expected in the left atrial pressure, left ventricular pressure, and right ventricular pressure after the successful repair of this ventricular septal defect?", "gold_answer": "Upon the successful repair of the ventricular septal defect (VSD) in the newborn, several changes in heart pressures are expected:\n\n1. **Left Atrial Pressure**: The left atrial pressure is expected to decrease. Before the repair, the extra blood from the left-to-right shunt would increase the blood volume returning to the left atrium, elevating its pressure. Once the VSD is closed, this extra volume is eliminated, thereby reducing the left atrial pressure.\n\n2. **Left Ventricular Pressure**: The left ventricular pressure may slightly increase. Prior to the repair, some of the blood output was being shunted into the right ventricle. Once this shunting stops, the left ventricle will push more of its output into the aorta, potentially increasing pressure slightly due to increased effective blood output in the appropriate direction. Overall, however, the left ventricle experiences less strain, as it’s not compensating for the shunted blood.\n\n3. **Right Ventricular Pressure**: The right ventricular pressure is expected to decrease. Initially, the right ventricle was handling a higher volume due to the shunted blood from the left ventricle. With the closure of the VSD, this additional volume is removed, reducing the pressure within the right ventricle as it returns to managing only the normal systemic venous return.\n\nOverall, closing the VSD alleviates the abnormal volume workload on both ventricles and normalizes heart function, leading to improved efficiencies throughout the heart's chambers."}
{"question": "A 25-year-old man of Mediterranean descent presents with yellowing of the skin and sclera, along with fatigue and fever. He is tachycardic and tachypneic, and his oxygen saturation is below 90%. Laboratory tests reveal increased unconjugated bilirubin, hemoglobinemia, and an elevated number of reticulocytes. Based on these clinical manifestations and laboratory findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation and laboratory findings strongly suggest that the most likely diagnosis is hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency. This diagnosis is supported by the increase in unconjugated bilirubin and hemoglobinemia, indicating the destruction of red blood cells. The elevated reticulocyte count suggests that the bone marrow is compensating for the loss of red blood cells. Given his Mediterranean descent, G6PD deficiency is a common condition in this population and can lead to acute hemolytic episodes, especially during oxidative stress such as infections or exposure to certain medications or foods."}
{"question": "In an-8-year-old child there is insufficient space in the\nupper anterior segment for the upper permanent lateral incisors to erupt. Treatment is:\nA. Disk the proximal surface of maxillary incisors\nB. Disk deciduous canines and first molars\nC. Extract the deciduous 1st molars\nD. No treatment required but observe", "gold_answer": "In the scenario where an 8-year-old child has insufficient space in the upper anterior segment for the upper permanent lateral incisors to erupt, the recommended approach is to disk the deciduous canines and first molars (Option B). This method provides a balanced solution by creating additional space for the erupting incisors without resorting to extraction, which could lead to alignment issues later on. It allows for natural adjustment while minimizing disruption to the dental structure."}
{"question": "A 24-year-old woman presents with symptoms of hopelessness, poor appetite, difficulty concentrating, and trouble with sleep. She reports poor self-esteem and feels unattractive, leading her to avoid romantic relationships. These symptoms have persisted for the past 3 years with only occasional brief improvements. Considering her family history includes a father with major depressive disorder and a physical exam suggesting a gloomy demeanor, what is the most likely diagnosis for her condition?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms you've described align closely with persistent depressive disorder (PDD), previously known as dysthymia. This condition is characterized by a chronic form of depression where an individual experiences a low mood for most of the day, for more days than not, over a period of at least two years. The consistent presence of symptoms such as hopelessness, poor appetite, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, and low self-esteem, especially persisting for three years, supports the diagnosis of PDD. Additionally, her family history of major depressive disorder in her father may suggest a genetic predisposition, although her symptoms' chronic nature is more indicative of PDD rather than episodic major depression. It's important that she seeks professional help to explore treatment options that may include therapy and medication to improve her quality of life."}
{"question": "On postoperative day 5, an otherwise healthy 55-year-old man recovering from a partial hepatectomy develops a fever of 38.6°C (101.5°F). What is the most common nosocomial infection that can occur postoperatively in such a patient?", "gold_answer": "In the postoperative setting, particularly by day 5, a patient who has undergone surgery and potentially has been catheterized is at an increased risk for developing nosocomial infections. Among these, the most common infection is a urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs frequently occur as they are associated with urinary catheters, which are often used during and following surgeries. Considering the timeline and hospital setting, a urinary tract infection is the most likely cause of the fever in this postoperative patient."}
{"question": "What is the mechanism through which ibuprofen or naproxen provide therapeutic effects in primary dysmenorrhea?", "gold_answer": "Ibuprofen and naproxen provide therapeutic effects in primary dysmenorrhea primarily through their action as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These medications work by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is crucial in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are compounds that cause the uterus to contract and are responsible for the menstrual cramps associated with dysmenorrhea. By blocking COX and subsequently reducing prostaglandin levels, ibuprofen and naproxen decrease the intensity of uterine contractions and alleviate menstrual pain, providing relief from the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea."}
{"question": "A 24-year-old man presents with progressive intermittent claudication in the left leg, where the popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses are normal on examination but disappear on dorsiflexion of the foot. Given these examination findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 24-year-old man with progressive intermittent claudication in the left leg, where the pulses remain normal on examination but disappear upon dorsiflexion of the foot, is popliteal artery entrapment syndrome. This condition occurs when the popliteal artery is compressed by surrounding muscles or tendons, particularly during certain movements, such as dorsiflexion, leading to reduced blood flow and intermittent claudication symptoms. The description you provided fits well with this diagnosis."}
{"question": "Describe the underlying pathophysiological mechanism associated with CD18 deficiency in the context of this 46-day-old baby's condition, presenting with elevated temperature, erosive periumbilical lesion, and laboratory findings.", "gold_answer": "CD18 deficiency, also known as Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type 1 (LAD-1), is an immunodeficiency disorder characterized by the inability of white blood cells, particularly neutrophils, to adhere to and transmigrate through blood vessel walls to sites of infection or injury. This defect arises due to mutations in the gene encoding CD18, a component of the beta-2 integrins on the surface of leukocytes. In a healthy immune response, these integrins play a critical role in the binding of leukocytes to endothelial cells, allowing them to exit the bloodstream and move into tissues where they're needed to combat infections.\n\nIn the case of the 46-day-old baby presenting with fever and an erosive periumbilical lesion, these symptoms align with the pathophysiological mechanisms of CD18 deficiency. The fever indicates an infection or inflammatory response, but due to the deficiency, the white blood cells are unable to reach the site of this infection effectively. As a result, despite an elevated white blood cell count, which signals the body's efforts to respond, the leukocytes remain circulating in the bloodstream rather than reaching the affected tissues. This leads to recurrent infections, poor wound healing, and unresolved inflammatory responses at sites such as the umbilicus, where the erosive lesion is observed.\n\nThe inability of the immune system to effectively localize and act is the central pathological mechanism in CD18 deficiency, leading to increased susceptibility to infections and chronic inflammatory reactions, as seen in the case of this young infant."}
{"question": "In a 45-year-old man with a history of severe persistent asthma and recent development of acute respiratory failure due to Aspergillus fumigatus infection, what is the most likely underlying mechanism responsible for the biopsy findings of mucus plugging, inflammatory cells, and fungal vascular invasion in the lungs?", "gold_answer": "In the 45-year-old man with a history of severe persistent asthma now experiencing acute respiratory failure due to an Aspergillus fumigatus infection, the biopsy findings of mucus plugging, inflammatory cells, and fungal vascular invasion in the lungs can most likely be attributed to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). \n\nIn ABPA, the immune system in individuals with asthma or cystic fibrosis overreacts to the presence of Aspergillus species, leading to an exaggerated inflammatory response. This involves the accumulation of mucus and infiltration of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils. The persistent inflammation and mucus plugging can cause damage to lung tissues, creating conditions that facilitate the fungal invasion into blood vessels.\n\nTherefore, ABPA related to the underlying severe asthma seems to be the primary mechanism responsible for these biopsy findings. The preexisting lung damage due to asthma and the exaggerated immune response provide a pathway for vascular invasion by the fungus, complicating the clinical picture and contributing to respiratory failure."}
{"question": "A 35-week pregnant multigravida presents with epigastric pain, headache, visual symptoms, and proteinuria 3+. What is the first step in the management of this patient?", "gold_answer": "The first step in the management of this patient, who is showing signs of severe preeclampsia at 35 weeks of pregnancy, is to administer magnesium sulfate. This medication is crucial for preventing seizures, thereby reducing the risk of the situation escalating to eclampsia. While other considerations such as managing blood pressure and planning for delivery are important, the immediate priority is to stabilize her condition with magnesium sulfate to address the severe symptoms and prevent convulsions."}
{"question": "A 5-year-old child who has been on phenytoin for seizure management is now due for a DTP immunization. Considering this medication, what is the most appropriate next step in the child's management?", "gold_answer": "The most appropriate next step in the management of this 5-year-old child is to proceed with administering the DTP vaccine as scheduled. There is no known direct interaction between phenytoin and the DTP vaccine that necessitates altering the vaccine schedule. While phenytoin is an enzyme inducer and affects the metabolism of other substances, it does not impact the efficacy or safety of the DTP vaccine. However, it is important to monitor the child for common side effects of both the vaccine, such as fever, and those associated with phenytoin use, to ensure prompt management if needed. Therefore, the child can receive the DTP immunization without any changes to their current seizure management plan."}
{"question": "A 22-year-old male developed fever, diarrhea, and vomiting 24 hours after eating chicken salad during an outing with friends. Two of his friends developed similar symptoms. What is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 22-year-old male is Salmonella gastroenteritis. The symptoms of fever, diarrhea, and vomiting occurring 24 hours after consuming chicken salad, along with similar symptoms seen in two friends, align with the common presentation of Salmonella infection. Chicken is a frequent carrier of Salmonella, and the timeline of symptom onset fits well within the typical incubation period for this type of foodborne illness."}
{"question": "In a 60-year-old diabetic male who presents with cough, sputum production, fever with chills and rigor, and specific findings on a chest X-ray, what are the indications for surgery?", "gold_answer": "In a 60-year-old diabetic male with pneumonia, surgery might be considered if specific severe complications arise that do not respond to medical management. These indications for surgical intervention include unresolved empyema, where pus in the pleural space does not resolve with antibiotics and drainage; a lung abscess that is resistant to antibiotics and drainage efforts; necrotizing pneumonia, where lung tissue destruction persists despite treatment; and a bronchopleural fistula, where abnormal air leakage into the pleural space continues. The presence of diabetes, which can impair the immune response, may further necessitate surgical intervention due to an increased risk of chronic or severe infection."}
{"question": "A 15 yrs old male patient presented with nasal mass reaching up to cheek causing unilateral nasal obstruction and intermittent epistaxis. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Juvenile nasal Angiofibroma\nB. Nasal Polyp\nC. Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma\nD.

Juvenile Nasal Angiofibroma. This condition is commonly found in adolescent males and aligns well with the symptoms presented, including the unilateral nasal issues and intermittent nosebleeds."}
{"question": "A 35-year-old woman has been brought to the emergency department after being involved in a house fire, presenting with confusion, shortness of breath, and burns over 36% of her body surface area. According to the Parkland formula, what is the most appropriate initial fluid regimen for this patient, specifying the type of fluid, total volume, and time frame for administration?", "gold_answer": "Based on the Parkland formula, the most appropriate initial fluid regimen for this patient, who has burns over 36% of her body surface area, involves using Ringer’s lactate as the fluid choice. \n\nFor an estimated weight of 70 kg:\n\n1. **Total Fluid Volume:** Calculate using the formula: \n   - \\(4 \\, \\text{mL} \\, \\times \\, 70 \\, \\text{kg} \\, \\times \\, 36 \\, \\text{\\% (TBSA)} = 10,080 \\, \\text{mL}\\) over the first 24 hours.\n\n2. **Administration Schedule:** \n   - **First 8 Hours:** Administer half of the total fluid volume, which is 5,040 mL.\n   - **Next 16 Hours:** Administer the remaining 5,040 mL. \n\nThe fluid administration should begin from the time of the burn injury, so it's important to adjust timing based on when she actually arrived in the emergency department relative to the time of injury. This regimen follows the guidelines closely to ensure proper resuscitation given the severity of her burns."}
{"question": "In a case where a child experiences the first episode of unprovoked seizures and continues to have seizures despite receiving two doses of Lorazepam, what is the next drug that should be administered?", "gold_answer": "In a situation where a child is experiencing an unprovoked seizure and the seizures persist despite two doses of Lorazepam, a logical next step is to administer Fosphenytoin. Fosphenytoin is often preferred because it can be delivered more quickly and with fewer cardiac side effects compared to Phenytoin. It's important to address status epilepticus effectively and promptly to prevent potential complications. Other options might include anticonvulsants like Valproate or Levetiracetam, depending on the specific circumstances and availability, but Fosphenytoin is commonly used in these scenarios following benzodiazepines."}
{"question": "What are the typical correct management practices and possible surgical outcomes associated with mesenteric vein thrombosis?", "gold_answer": "The management of mesenteric vein thrombosis involves a multi-faceted approach tailored to the severity and progression of the condition. The primary strategy is anticoagulation therapy, typically initiated with medications such as heparin or warfarin. These blood thinners are crucial in preventing the formation of new clots and mitigating the risk of serious complications like bowel ischemia. Alongside anticoagulation, supportive care is vital. This includes ensuring proper hydration, effective pain management, and monitoring for any signs of bowel ischemia or infarction, which would necessitate immediate intervention.\n\nIn cases where anticoagulation is not sufficient, thrombolysis may be considered to actively dissolve clots using specific medications. However, if the patient shows signs of intestinal infarction or peritoneal symptoms indicative of significant ischemia, surgery becomes necessary. Surgical intervention aims to address any infarction or necrosis of the bowel. This might involve resecting affected portions of the intestine and managing any obstruction caused by the clot.\n\nThe surgical outcomes can vary significantly based on the timing of intervention and the extent of ischemic damage. Early intervention typically leads to better outcomes, with the goal of restoring adequate blood flow and removing necrotic tissue. However, surgery carries inherent risks such as postoperative infections and potential complications like short bowel syndrome if a large section of the intestine is removed. Ultimately, the success of surgical management largely depends on prompt diagnosis and treatment, coupled with the patient’s overall health condition at the time of intervention.\n\nIn summary, mesenteric vein thrombosis management is a combination of anticoagulation therapy, supportive care, and possibly surgery, with outcomes heavily reliant on the timeliness of treatment."}
{"question": "A previously healthy 3-month-old girl is brought to the physician with fever, irritability, and a rash that started around the mouth and spread to the trunk and extremities, characterized by a diffuse erythematous rash with flaccid bullae. Gentle pressure on the skin creates a blister. Oropharyngeal examination is normal. What is the most likely underlying mechanism responsible for the skin findings in this patient?", "gold_answer": "The most likely underlying mechanism responsible for the skin findings in this 3-month-old girl is the action of an exfoliative toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus. This toxin targets a protein in the skin called desmoglein-1, which is essential for cell adhesion in the epidermis. By disrupting the connections between skin cells, the toxin leads to the formation of blisters and the positive Nikolsky's sign observed in conditions like staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). This explains the combination of symptoms including fever, irritability, and the diffuse erythematous rash with flaccid bullae."}
{"question": "What is the name of the heat-stable enzyme obtained from Thermophilus aquaticus bacterium, which is commonly used in PCR at high temperatures?", "gold_answer": "The heat-stable enzyme obtained from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus, which is commonly used in PCR at high temperatures, is called Taq polymerase. This enzyme is crucial for the PCR process because it remains stable and active even at the high temperatures required to denature DNA strands, allowing for efficient DNA amplification."}
{"question": "Why is rheumatoid factor considered significant in the context of rheumatoid arthritis?", "gold_answer": "Rheumatoid factor (RF) is considered significant in the context of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for several reasons. Firstly, RF is an antibody that can be measured in the blood and is often elevated in individuals with RA. This makes it a useful marker in the diagnostic process, as many people with RA have high RF levels. While not specific to RA, it helps support the diagnosis when combined with typical symptoms like joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.\n\nAdditionally, RF is valuable in determining the prognosis of RA. Patients with high RF levels often experience a more aggressive form of the disease, leading to greater joint damage and potentially affecting other organs. Therefore, RF is not only significant for diagnosing RA but also for understanding the likely severity and progression of the disease, aiding clinicians in tailoring treatment approaches. Despite its lack of specificity, RF remains an important piece of the overall diagnostic and prognostic puzzle for rheumatoid arthritis."}
{"question": "Racemic mixture of two enantiomers with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties is seen in:\nA. Dilantin\nB. Digoxin\nC. Verapamil\nD. Octreotide", "gold_answer": "The correct answer is: C. Verapamil\n\nVerapamil is indeed a racemic mixture composed of two enantiomers, (R)-verapamil and (S)-verapamil, each possessing distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The (S)-enantiomer is significantly more potent in terms of its cardiovascular effects compared to the (R)-enantiomer. Additionally, the enantiomers can differ in how they are distributed and metabolized in the body, contributing to their distinct clinical effects. This characteristic makes Verapamil a clear example of a drug with enantiomers exhibiting varied effects, confirming it as the correct option here."}
{"question": "What is the total fertility rate and how can it be described in terms of its components or calculations?", "gold_answer": "The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is a demographic measure that represents the average number of children a woman would have over her lifetime, based on current age-specific fertility rates. It is an important indicator used to understand population growth or decline trends within a society.\n\nTo calculate the TFR, demographers consider the age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs), which show the average number of children born to women in specific age groups, typically divided into five-year intervals from age 15 to 49. By summing the ASFRs across all age groups and multiplying by the interval (usually five years), you estimate the total number of children a woman would have if she experienced current age-specific fertility rates throughout her reproductive life.\n\nA TFR of approximately 2.1 is considered the replacement level in many developed countries. This means each woman, on average, has enough children to \"replace\" herself and her partner, accounting for infant mortality and other factors. A TFR above 2.1 suggests a growing population, while a TFR below 2.1 indicates potential population decline, assuming no immigration or emigration impacts.\n\nIn summary, the TFR provides insight into future demographic shifts based on existing birth patterns, helping policymakers and researchers understand potential growth or decline in a population."}
{"question": "A 6-year-old boy presents with hematuria following a sore throat and fever two weeks ago. Laboratory results show decreased serum C3 levels and elevated anti-DNAse B titer. What would you expect to see on renal biopsy based on these clinical findings?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical findings, the 6-year-old boy is likely experiencing post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). On renal biopsy, the expected findings would include:\n\n1. **Electron Microscopy**: This would show subepithelial 'hump-like' deposits, which are characteristic of PSGN. These humps result from immune complexes depositing along the glomerular basement membrane.\n\n2. **Light Microscopy**: You would see glomerular hypercellularity due to proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells, as well as an increase in inflammatory cells.\n\n3. **Immunofluorescence**: There would be a granular pattern of IgG, IgM, and C3 deposits along the glomerular capillary walls and within the mesangium.\n\nThese findings align with the clinical history of a recent streptococcal infection, decreased serum C3 levels, and elevated anti-DNAse B titers, which are indicative of PSGN."}
{"question": "A 9-year-old boy exhibits frequent blinking, disruptive behavior in class, and fluctuating mood episodes such as being overly elated and hyperactive followed by periods of sadness and withdrawal. Despite disciplinary efforts and behavioral therapy, his symptoms persist. Considering these symptoms and the lack of recent illness or substance use, what medication should be prescribed to address his condition, especially the frequent blinking and distractibility?", "gold_answer": "Given the symptoms described—a frequent blinking tic, disruptive hyperactive behavior, and fluctuating moods—one potential medication that could address these issues is guanfacine. Guanfacine is often used to treat ADHD symptoms, including hyperactivity and impulsivity, and can also be beneficial for managing tics. As a non-stimulant, guanfacine may also be advantageous when mood fluctuations are part of the symptom profile, providing a more balanced approach to treatment. Behavioral therapy should continue alongside medication to support long-term management. Always consult with a healthcare professional to tailor treatment to the child's specific needs."}
{"question": "What condition should be suspected in a newborn who fails to pass meconium within 48 hours of birth and shows no obvious external abnormalities?", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided, the condition that should be suspected in a newborn who fails to pass meconium within 48 hours of birth and shows no obvious external abnormalities is likely Hirschsprung's disease. This condition is characterized by a lack of nerve cells in parts of the colon, leading to a blockage due to improper bowel motility. It's a common reason for delayed passage of meconium in newborns when other external abnormalities are not present."}

These changes reflect the typical hormonal profile seen during menopause, where decreased estrogen levels lead to an increase in FSH, LH, and GnRH as the body attempts to compensate for the reduced estrogen production by the ovaries. The symptoms she is experiencing, such as painful intercourse due to vaginal dryness, poor sleep, and hot flashes, align with this phase of hormonal transition."}
{"question": "A 1-year-old girl presents with symptoms including dry flakes and yellow, greasy scales with reddened skin on the scalp, facial redness, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. X-ray imaging reveals multiple lytic lesions in long bones. What is the most likely diagnosis for this combination of symptoms and findings?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and findings you've described—seborrheic-like dermatitis on the scalp, facial redness, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and particularly the presence of multiple lytic lesions in long bones—are highly indicative of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) in this 1-year-old girl. LCH is a rare disorder where there is an overproduction of Langerhans cells, leading to tissue infiltration and the spectrum of systemic symptoms you noted, including skin changes, involvement of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes, and characteristic skeletal lesions. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this combination of symptoms and findings is Langerhans cell histiocytosis."}
{"question": "A child had hematuria and nephrotic syndrome (minimal change disease) was diagnosed. True about it is :\nA. A type of focal segmental GN\nB. IgA deposition on basement membrane\nC. Foot process of glomerular membrane normal\nD. Glomerular function is lost due to loss of poly charge on both sites of glomerular foot process", "gold_answer": "The correct answer is: **D. Glomerular function is lost due to loss of poly charge on both sites of glomerular foot process**\n\nIn minimal change disease, which is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, the main pathological finding is the effacement of the podocyte foot processes. This condition is characterized by the loss of negative charges on the glomerular filtration barrier, which includes the glomerular basement membrane and the foot processes of podocytes. This charge alteration leads to increased protein permeability, resulting in the nephrotic range proteinuria seen in patients. There are no immune complex depositions as in other types of glomerulonephritis, and it is distinct from focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which involves structural damage and scarring of the glomeruli. Furthermore, because of the subtle histological changes seen under light microscopy, such as absence of IgA or other immune deposits, minimal change disease is described based on its electron microscopy findings."}
{"question": "A 25-year-old female presents with mild pallor and moderate hepatosplenomegaly. Her hemoglobin level is 92 g/L, and her fetal hemoglobin level is 65%. She has never received a blood transfusion. Based on these clinical findings and laboratory results, what condition is she most likely suffering from?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical findings and laboratory results, the 25-year-old female is most likely suffering from beta-thalassemia intermedia. The presence of mild pallor and moderate hepatosplenomegaly, along with a significantly elevated fetal hemoglobin level of 65% and a hemoglobin level of 92 g/L, are indicative of this condition. The fact that she has never received a blood transfusion suggests a moderate form of the disorder, as is characteristic of beta-thalassemia intermedia, which typically presents with less severe symptoms compared to beta-thalassemia major, hence not requiring regular blood transfusions."}
{"question": "A 32-year-old woman, 3 weeks postpartum, is experiencing an inability to lactate, sensitivity to cold, fatigue, lightheadedness, and weight gain following a delivery complicated by placenta accreta and significant blood loss. In a panel of hormone tests, given her symptoms and recent history, which hormone level is most likely to be normal?", "gold_answer": "In the described scenario, the woman is likely suffering from Sheehan's syndrome due to the significant blood loss during delivery. This condition affects the pituitary gland's ability to produce various hormones, impacting levels of prolactin, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), and ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), among others. These deficiencies explain her symptoms like inability to lactate, cold sensitivity, fatigue, and lightheadedness.\n\nHowever, aldosterone is regulated by the renin-angiotensin system, which is independent of the pituitary gland. Therefore, unlike the other pituitary-dependent hormones, aldosterone levels are likely to remain normal.\n\nThus, the hormone level most likely to be normal is aldosterone."}
{"question": "What is the most likely cause of amenorrhoea in a 30-year-old woman who has 6 months of amenorrhoea, high serum LH and FSH levels, and low estradiol levels?", "gold_answer": "The most likely cause of amenorrhoea in a 30-year-old woman with 6 months of amenorrhoea, high serum LH and FSH levels, and low estradiol levels is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure. This condition occurs when the ovaries stop functioning properly before the age of 40, leading to decreased production of estrogen and disruption of the menstrual cycle. The elevated levels of LH and FSH reflect the body's attempt to stimulate the ovaries, which are no longer responding adequately."}
{"question": "Before initiating lithium therapy for a 31-year-old female patient diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder, which specific laboratory tests should be performed to ensure patient safety and suitability for the medication?", "gold_answer": "Before initiating lithium therapy for a 31-year-old female patient diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder, it is important to perform specific laboratory tests to ensure her safety and suitability for the medication. The recommended tests include:\n\n1. **Renal Function Tests:** Evaluate the patient's serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels to assess kidney function, as lithium is excreted through the kidneys and can affect renal function.\n\n2. **Thyroid Function Tests:** Conduct a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test to establish a baseline, since lithium can induce hypothyroidism.\n\n3. **Serum Electrolytes:** Check the patient's sodium levels, among other electrolytes, because lithium's therapeutic and toxic effects can be influenced by sodium balance.\n\n4. **Pregnancy Test:** Given the patient's age and potential for pregnancy, a pregnancy test is advisable to prevent fetal exposure, as lithium has known teratogenic risks.\n\nThese tests will help ensure that the patient is an appropriate candidate for lithium therapy and facilitate ongoing monitoring to mitigate potential side effects during treatment."}
{"question": "Based on the symptoms of significant muscle weakness in the entire left lower body, impaired vibration and proprioception in the left leg, and loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right leg, which specific section of the spinal cord was most likely damaged in a 22-year-old man who suffered a puncture injury around the T9 level?", "gold_answer": "The specific section of the spinal cord that was most likely damaged in the 22-year-old man with these symptoms is the left hemisection at the T9 level. This pattern of symptoms—muscle weakness and impaired proprioception and vibration sensation on the left side, combined with loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right side—aligns with Brown-Séquard syndrome. This condition results from damage to one side of the spinal cord, causing distinct deficits due to the different pathways followed by motor, proprioceptive, vibration, and pain/temperature sensations."}

From which cords of the brachial plexus is the nerve that supplies the relevant muscles formed?", "gold_answer": "The median nerve, which is responsible for flexing the forefinger, is formed from fibers originating from both the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus. If there's an issue with flexing the forefinger, it might be attributed to a problem involving this nerve."}
{"question": "A 45-year-old woman presents with bilateral joint pain and stiffness in her hand joints for 3 months, along with mild swelling and tenderness in proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints, nodules near the elbows, and X-ray findings of soft tissue swelling and joint space narrowing. Her hematocrit is 32% and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 40 mm/hr, with a low-grade fever. Given her clinical presentation, what is this patient at greatest risk of developing as a complication of her condition?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical presentation, this 45-year-old woman appears to have rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition characterized by chronic inflammation, primarily affecting the joints and potentially leading to systemic complications. Among various risks associated with rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease is one of the most significant and well-documented complications. This is due to the chronic systemic inflammation that can accelerate atherosclerosis, leading to an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes.\n\nTherefore, in the context of her rheumatoid arthritis, this patient is at the greatest risk of developing cardiovascular disease as a complication of her condition. It's important for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis to have regular monitoring and management of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including inflammation control, to mitigate this heightened risk."}
{"question": "In the management of a patient who has overdosed on amitriptyline, what is a common misconception regarding the use of atropine sulphate?", "gold_answer": "A common misconception in managing a patient who has overdosed on amitriptyline is that atropine sulphate should be used routinely to treat potential cardiac issues, such as bradycardia. However, amitriptyline overdose often results in anticholinergic effects, which can already cause symptoms like an increased heart rate (tachycardia). Since atropine also has anticholinergic properties, its use without clear evidence of bradycardia can exacerbate these effects, potentially worsening tachycardia and other central nervous system symptoms. Therefore, atropine should only be used cautiously and if there is definite evidence of significant bradycardia in the context of amitriptyline overdose. Understanding the specifics of the overdose's effects and the careful evaluation of the patient's symptoms are crucial in guiding appropriate treatment decisions."}
{"question": "A 57-year-old man presents with episodic left periorbital pain that radiates to the left frontotemporal side of his head for the last 2 weeks. The episodes are severe and typically last for 1–2 hours before bedtime. He also experiences lacrimation on the left side and a runny nose during these episodes. Over-the-counter analgesics have been ineffective, and he currently has a headache. Physical examination reveals left-sided Horner's syndrome. Considering these symptoms, what is the next best step in the acute management of this patient's most likely condition?", "gold_answer": "The patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of cluster headaches, characterized by severe unilateral periorbital pain, lacrimation, nasal congestion, and the presence of Horner's syndrome on the affected side. In the acute management of cluster headaches, the next best step is to provide high-flow oxygen therapy. Administering 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 12-15 liters per minute via a non-rebreather mask typically offers relief within 15 minutes for many patients. This approach is both effective and well-tolerated, making it an ideal initial treatment for acute cluster headache episodes."}

What is the attributable risk percentage associated with this exposure?", "gold_answer": "The attributable risk percentage associated with the exposure of having multiple sexual partners, resulting in a 5 times increased risk for cervical carcinoma, is 80%. This means that 80% of the increased risk can be attributed to the exposure of having multiple partners."}
{"question": "An 80-year-old woman presents with diffuse muscle pain and symptoms suggesting neurological impairment. On examination, she is obtunded with paralysis of the left side of her body, and lab findings indicate increased serum creatinine disproportionate to BUN levels. Which type of ECG changes are most likely to correspond to the most common electrolyte abnormality associated with this condition?", "gold_answer": "In this scenario, the symptoms and lab results suggest rhabdomyolysis, a condition where muscle breakdown leads to the release of intracellular contents, including electrolytes, into the bloodstream. One common electrolyte imbalance associated with rhabdomyolysis is hyperkalemia, an elevated level of potassium in the blood.\n\nHyperkalemia can cause specific changes in an ECG. The most characteristic ECG finding associated with elevated potassium levels is peaked T waves. This initial change can progress to more severe manifestations like a widened QRS complex if the hyperkalemia is not addressed.\n\nTherefore, given this clinical picture, the ECG changes most likely to correspond with the common electrolyte abnormality (hyperkalemia) in rhabdomyolysis would be peaked T waves."}
{"question": "A woman presents with symptoms of colored halos around lights in the evening, nausea, and vomiting, but with normal intraocular pressure. What is the likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms of seeing colored halos around lights, nausea, and vomiting, even with normal intraocular pressure, suggest a likely diagnosis of intermittent or subacute angle-closure glaucoma. In this condition, the intraocular pressure may not remain elevated consistently, making it possible for the pressure to appear normal during an examination if not done during an acute episode. This type of glaucoma can cause the systemic symptoms of nausea and vomiting due to sudden changes in intraocular dynamics during an episode. It's crucial for the woman to undergo a comprehensive eye examination to determine the exact cause and to prevent permanent damage to her vision. The examination can help confirm whether the angle-closure is indeed the issue, or if another condition like corneal edema is contributing to her symptoms."}
{"question": "A 27-year-old dental radiographer presented with red lesions on his palate, lips, and finger, slightly painful and accompanied by a low-grade fever prior to lesion development. A Tzanck smear of the lesions showed multinucleated epithelial giant cells. Based on this clinical presentation and histologic finding, which viral infection is most likely responsible?", "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation and histologic findings you've described strongly point towards an infection with Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). The painful red lesions on the palate, lips, and finger, along with a preceding low-grade fever, align with the symptoms seen in herpes simplex infections. Additionally, the presence of multinucleated epithelial giant cells in the Tzanck smear is a classic finding associated with HSV. While these giant cells can also be seen in Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) infections, the localized nature of the lesions and the patient's context make HSV the more likely cause. Therefore, an infection with Herpes Simplex Virus is most likely responsible for the symptoms this individual is experiencing."}
{"question": "A 73-year-old man with a history of strange behavior changes, urinary incontinence, and past stroke has an examination showing disorientation in time, inattention, short-stepped gait, and slowed movements. Based on these clinical features, what specific pathological finding would most likely be seen on a brain biopsy?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical features described, the specific pathological finding that would most likely be seen on a brain biopsy is the presence of Lewy bodies. These intracellular inclusions are characteristic of conditions such as Dementia with Lewy bodies, which can present with disorientation, inattention, short-stepped gait, slowed movements, and behavioral changes. The presence of Lewy bodies on a biopsy would align with these symptoms."}

{"question": "When preparing to administer Amphotericin B (Fungizone) IV to a client with aspergillosis, which pre-medication should the nurse not anticipate giving to prevent side effects?", "gold_answer": "When preparing to administer Amphotericin B (Fungizone) IV, the nurse should not anticipate giving ondansetron as pre-medication to prevent side effects. Ondansetron is primarily used to manage nausea and vomiting, which are not the primary concerns with Amphotericin B. Instead, focus would typically be on using medications like acetaminophen to prevent fever and diphenhydramine for managing potential allergic reactions, with corticosteroids considered for more severe inflammatory responses."}
{"question": "What is the most likely pathological finding in the peripheral nerves of a 49-year-old female presenting with a non-healing ulcer on the right medial malleolus, symmetrical loss of sensation in both extremities, recurrent white vaginal discharge, irregular menstrual cycles, and hot flashes?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms and considerations outlined, the most likely pathological finding in the peripheral nerves for this patient would be an \"axonal neuropathy.\" This condition is characterized by damage to the nerve fibers themselves (axons), typically seen in systemic conditions such as diabetes and nutritional deficiencies. The presentation of a non-healing ulcer, symmetrical loss of sensation, alongside hormonal symptoms, suggests a systemic issue that is affecting multiple systems, with axonal neuropathy providing a consistent explanation for the nerve involvement."}
{"question": "A male newborn, born at term to a healthy mother, presents six hours after delivery with feeding intolerance and several episodes of bilious vomiting. He has physical features such as epicanthus, upward slanting of the eyelids, low-set ears, and a single transverse palmar crease, and has a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur. The abdominal examination shows a distended upper abdomen and a concave-shaped lower abdomen without organomegaly. Based on these clinical findings and an abdominal x-ray, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical findings and the abdominal X-ray, the most likely diagnosis for this newborn is duodenal atresia. The presence of characteristic physical features suggests Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), which is commonly associated with duodenal atresia. The symptoms of bilious vomiting shortly after birth, along with the abdominal examination showing a distended upper abdomen and a concave lower abdomen, align with this condition. An abdominal X-ray would likely reveal the classic \"double bubble\" sign, characteristic of duodenal atresia, where the stomach and proximal duodenum are distended with air, but there is no air distally."}
{"question": "What neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas is most commonly associated with the manifestation of a skin rash known as necrolytic migratory erythema?", "gold_answer": "The neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas most commonly associated with necrolytic migratory erythema is glucagonoma.

This tumor is unique in its presentation due to the combination of these symptoms, particularly the skin manifestations."}
{"question": "A 47-year-old alcoholic man presents with a 72-hour history of intense right hemithorax pain, fever, chills, sweating, and a persistent cough with abundant malodorous sputum lasting 10 days. Chest radiography reveals a round consolidation with air-fluid levels in the middle third of the right hemithorax. Based on these clinical and radiological findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation and radiological findings suggest that the most likely diagnosis is a lung abscess. The history of alcohol use and symptoms such as intense right-side chest pain, fever, chills, sweating, and a cough producing malodorous sputum are consistent with this condition. The chest X-ray showing a round consolidation with air-fluid levels in the right lung further supports the diagnosis of a lung abscess, which often results when bacteria, particularly anaerobic bacteria from the mouth, are aspirated into the lungs. This matches well with the patient's profile, including the risk factors and symptomatology."}
{"question": "When diagnosing acute pancreatitis in a patient with severe upper abdominal pain, what is one condition that does not need to be ruled out as part of the differential diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "When diagnosing acute pancreatitis in a patient with severe upper abdominal pain, a condition that does not need to be ruled out as part of the differential diagnosis is a migraine. Migraines typically present with symptoms such as headaches and do not align with the abdominal pain associated with acute pancreatitis. Therefore, they would not typically be considered relevant in this context."}

This method allows for the rapid detection of fungal elements in the nail, providing immediate results. Therefore, the KOH preparation is the best choice for early and efficient diagnosis."}
{"question": "In the context of malignancy, how is anaplasia typically manifested in muscle tumor cells?", "gold_answer": "In the context of malignancy, anaplasia in muscle tumor cells is characterized by a significant loss of the cells' normal and distinctive features. Typically, muscle cells have a structured organization with elongated shapes, multiple nuclei, especially in skeletal muscle, and are striated. When anaplasia occurs, these characteristic features are diminished or entirely absent, indicating a transformation to a more malignant state.\n\nIn such malignant muscle tumors, the cells exhibit pleomorphic shapes, meaning they vary significantly in form and size, diverging from the uniform appearance of healthy muscle cells. The nuclei undergo hyperchromasia, appearing darker and larger due to increased chromatin content, and display a high level of mitotic activity, reflecting uncontrolled and abnormal cell division. This results in a disorganized arrangement of tissue, with the typical muscle architecture being completely disrupted. Hence, anaplasia in muscle tumor cells is manifested through these cellular and structural aberrations, signifying the cells' loss of differentiated muscle identity and their reversion to a more primitive, often malignant, state."}
{"question": "In which specific types of glaucoma and other conditions is peripheral iridectomy indicated?", "gold_answer": "Peripheral iridectomy is primarily indicated for conditions where there is a risk of blockage of aqueous humor flow due to iris obstruction. This procedure is most commonly associated with:\n\n1. **Narrow-Angle Glaucoma**: In this condition, the anterior chamber angle is narrow, increasing the risk of blockages that can lead to increased intraocular pressure. A peripheral iridectomy helps open up the drainage angle, facilitating fluid flow.\n\n2. **Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma**: This type of glaucoma is an urgent situation where the iris blocks the drainage angle, causing an acute rise in intraocular pressure. An iridectomy provides an alternative pathway for fluid flow, alleviating the pressure urgently.\n\n3. **Plateau Iris Syndrome**: Here, the iris is anatomically positioned in such a way that it predisposes the eye to angle closure. A peripheral iridectomy can help in preventing angle-closure episodes by creating an additional outflow pathway for the aqueous humor.\n\n4. **Preventive Measure**: For individuals who have had angle-closure episodes in one eye, prophylactic peripheral iridectomy might be performed on the other eye to prevent similar episodes.\n\n5. **Pigmentary Glaucoma**: Although less commonly indicated, in pigmentary glaucoma, the redistribution of pigment granules can obstruct the trabecular meshwork. An iridectomy may help manage the outflow if the iris position is contributory to the obstruction.\n\nIn these situations, peripheral iridectomy serves a critical role in managing fluid dynamics within the eye, protecting against optic nerve damage, and preserving vision."}
{"question": "In a newborn, how soon after birth should the murmur from a patent ductus arteriosus typically disappear?", "gold_answer": "In a healthy term newborn, the murmur caused by a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) typically disappears by the end of the second or third day after birth. This is because the ductus arteriosus usually begins to close once the baby starts breathing air, and most PDAs in full-term infants close naturally within the first couple of days. If the murmur persists beyond this timeframe, it might indicate that the ductus arteriosus has not closed as expected, and a healthcare provider may need to evaluate the situation further. However, in most cases, nature takes its course, and the murmur resolves as the ductus arteriosus closes."}

She is worried about potential weight gain from the medication. Considering her condition and concerns, which antipsychotic medication is most appropriate to minimize weight gain?", "gold_answer": "Given the patient's concerns about weight gain and her symptoms of panic attacks, hallucinations, and short attention span, aripiprazole would be an appropriate choice for an antipsychotic medication. Aripiprazole is known for having a lower risk of causing weight gain compared to other antipsychotic medications like olanzapine and clozapine. It should address her symptoms effectively while minimizing the potential for additional weight gain, aligning well with her treatment needs and concerns."}
{"question": "Based on the presentation of a 6-year-old boy with a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and his left tonsil being pushed medially accompanied by swelling on the left side of his upper neck, what is the diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms you've described, it is most likely that the 6-year-old boy is experiencing a parapharyngeal abscess. The key indicators leading to this diagnosis include the medial displacement of the left tonsil and the significant swelling on the left side of the upper neck. While peritonsillar abscesses also cause displacement of the tonsil, the notable neck swelling aligns well with the characteristics of a parapharyngeal abscess, especially given the age and presentation. Parapharyngeal abscesses can develop as complications of tonsillitis or other throat infections and involve deeper neck spaces, explaining both the throat and neck findings. It's important to evaluate this further with appropriate imaging and possible intervention to confirm the diagnosis and provide necessary treatment."}
{"question": "An 80-year-old woman is experiencing progressive forgetfulness, difficulty in multitasking, and trouble with activities of daily living, along with agnosia, aphasia, and anomia, but has a normal gait. Based on these symptoms, which brain structure is most likely atrophied and which gene is typically associated with this condition?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms described in the question, such as progressive forgetfulness, difficulty in multitasking, trouble with activities of daily living, and language issues like agnosia, aphasia, and anomia, are indicative of Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, the hippocampus, which is crucial for forming new memories, is one of the primary brain structures that tends to atrophy. Additionally, the ApoE4 (Apolipoprotein E4) allele is a gene typically associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the brain structure most likely atrophied is the hippocampus, and the gene typically associated with this condition is ApoE4."}
{"question": "A 42-year-old man presents with symptoms including tingling in his extremities, hand cramps, and palpitations, with a history of daily heavy alcohol consumption and recent discharge against medical advice for acute pancreatitis. He exhibits carpopedal spasm, increased deep tendon reflexes, and confusion. Based on these clinical findings and history, what is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for his condition?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms and history of heavy alcohol consumption, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this man's condition is the administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate. His presentation suggests hypomagnesemia, particularly given the alcohol abuse, recent pancreatitis, and symptoms like tingling, cramps, confusion, and increased reflexes. Addressing the magnesium deficiency can also help normalize calcium and potentially potassium levels, resolving the neuromuscular and cognitive symptoms more effectively."}
{"question": "A 66-year-old male heart failure patient presents with symptoms including shortness of breath, leg swelling, and hypotension. An echocardiography shows an ejection fraction of 18%. The physician decides to add an inotropic agent to his treatment. Predict how this intervention will affect the timing between the heart sounds in the cardiac cycle.", "gold_answer": "In this situation, the addition of an inotropic agent is aimed at improving the heart's contractile strength, given this patient's severely reduced ejection fraction. Inotropic agents increase the force of the heart's contractions, which can enhance cardiac output even in the presence of heart failure.\n\nWith respect to how this affects the heart sounds S1 and S2, the inotropic effect would most likely lead to a shortening of the interval between these sounds. This is because the systolic phase, when the heart is contracting, would be completed more quickly and efficiently with stronger contractions. Thus, the timing between S1 (the sound associated with the closure of atrioventricular valves as systole begins) and S2 (the sound linked to the closure of aortic and pulmonary valves as systole ends) would decrease, indicating a more effective and rapid contraction phase.\n\nOverall, the use of an inotropic agent in this heart failure treatment is predicted to shorten the duration between S1 and S2 by enhancing the speed and efficiency of the heart's contractions."}
{"question": "A 70-year-old man presents with symptoms including prosopagnosia, loss of memory, and third-person hallucinations for the past month. On examination, his deep tendon reflexes are increased, and he scored 20 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination. Based on these clinical findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical findings and symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis for the 70-year-old man is Alzheimer's disease. The symptoms of prosopagnosia and memory loss align with the characteristic cortical and cognitive impairments seen in Alzheimer's. The presence of hallucinations, while not the most common early symptom, can occur, especially as the disease progresses. The increased deep tendon reflexes may signify broader cortical involvement, commonly associated with advanced neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's. While other conditions such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease or Lewy Body Dementia could also be considered, the combination of symptoms and their rapid onset suggest Alzheimer's as the most fitting diagnosis in this context."}
{"question": "A 22-year-old man with a history of anxiety and depression, taking clonazepam, amitriptyline, and lorazepam, presents to the emergency department with anxiety, confusion, and withdrawal symptoms after not taking his home medications. With a pulse of 112/min and respiratory rate of 22/min but normal oxygen saturation, what medication should be administered to address his condition?", "gold_answer": "To address this patient's condition, which is likely due to benzodiazepine withdrawal given his symptoms of anxiety and confusion along with a history of taking clonazepam and lorazepam, the administration of diazepam would be appropriate. Diazepam is an effective choice in this scenario because it provides rapid symptom relief due to its fast onset and also offers prolonged effects, which can help stabilize the patient over a more extended period."}
{"question": "What medication is known to cause open neural tube defects when taken during pregnancy?", "gold_answer": "Valproate, also known as valproic acid, is a medication that is known to cause open neural tube defects when taken during pregnancy. This risk is well-documented, and significant caution is advised for its use in pregnant women due to the potential disruption of folate metabolism, which is crucial for proper neural tube development."}
{"question": "What are the recommended dietary allowances for iron and iodine during pregnancy?", "gold_answer": "During pregnancy, the recommended dietary allowances are 27 milligrams of iron per day and 220 micrograms of iodine per day. These amounts are suggested to meet the increased nutritional needs of both the mother and the developing baby. Iron is essential for producing hemoglobin, thereby supporting the increased blood volume required during pregnancy. Iodine is crucial for proper thyroid function and is vital for the baby's brain and nervous system development."}
{"question": "What is the likely diagnosis for a 1-year-old child who presents with muscle wasting, loss of subcutaneous fat, no signs of edema, and weight below 60% of WHO standard, given a history of insufficient protein and nutrient intake after six months of age?", "gold_answer": "The likely diagnosis for the 1-year-old child based on the presented symptoms is Marasmus. Marasmus is characterized by severe wasting of muscles and loss of subcutaneous fat due to significant energy and protein deficiency. The key indicators here are the muscle wasting, lack of subcutaneous fat, and notably, the absence of edema, which distinguishes it from Kwashiorkor, another type of severe malnutrition that typically involves edema. The weight being below 60% of the WHO standard further supports this diagnosis. Given the history of insufficient nutrient intake after six months, Marasmus is the most consistent diagnosis. It's important for the child to receive immediate nutritional rehabilitation to address this severe form of malnutrition."}
{"question": "A 50-year-old male presented with fever and chills along with chest pain during cough. His sputum specimen was cultured on blood agar and showed the presence of alpha-hemolytic colonies the next day. When further processing this organism, what characteristics would you expect to find?", "gold_answer": "Based on the presentation and laboratory findings you described, the characteristics you're likely to find in this organism, Streptococcus pneumoniae, include:\n\n1. **Optochin Sensitivity:** Streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to optochin. In laboratory tests, it will show a clear zone of inhibition around an optochin disc placed on the agar, differentiating it from other alpha-hemolytic streptococci like the viridans group.\n\n2. **Bile Solubility:** This organism is soluble in bile. The presence of bile triggers the autolytic enzymes in S. pneumoniae, leading to cell lysis. This is a key differentiator in distinguishing it from other Streptococcus species that also exhibit alpha-hemolysis.\n\nThese characteristics align with the presentation of respiratory infection symptoms and the laboratory findings of alpha-hemolytic colonies on blood agar, making Streptococcus pneumoniae the most likely organism involved."}
{"question": "Variation in sensitivity of response to different doses of a drug in different individual is obtained from?\nA. Dose response curve\nB. Therapeutic index\nC. Bioavailability\nD. Phase 1 clinical trials", "gold_answer": "The variation in sensitivity of response to different doses of a drug in different individuals is typically obtained from D. Phase 1 clinical trials. These trials, which are primarily designed to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of a drug in humans, often reveal how different individuals respond to varying doses. This early phase helps identify potential variations in response among participants."}
{"question": "A 55-year-old man with a history of IV drug abuse presents to the emergency department with altered mental status, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis. Based on this clinical presentation and the laboratory findings of serum bicarbonate at 19 mEq/L, what is the most appropriate treatment to address both his blood pressure issues and his acid-base disorder?", "gold_answer": "The presentation you've described is highly suggestive of septic shock, likely secondary to an infection related to the patient's history of IV drug use. In this situation, the most appropriate initial treatment to address both the hypotension and the metabolic acidosis is aggressive fluid resuscitation with intravenous normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution. Providing fluids will help to improve circulation, increase blood pressure, and potentially correct the acidosis by improving tissue perfusion and reducing the production of lactic acid.\n\nIf the patient's blood pressure does not adequately respond to fluid resuscitation, initiation of vasopressors such as norepinephrine would be indicated to further support blood pressure and improve perfusion. Simultaneously, it's crucial to identify and treat any underlying infection with broad-spectrum antibiotics as soon as possible. Early fluid resuscitation combined with appropriate antibiotic therapy is pivotal in managing septic shock and stabilizing the patient's condition."}
{"question": "A patient arrives in the emergency room with hypotension, respiratory distress, and subcutaneous emphysema, with no air entry on one side. Considering these symptoms, what is the most appropriate immediate management step?", "gold_answer": "Given the symptoms of hypotension, respiratory distress, subcutaneous emphysema, and lack of air entry on one side of the chest, the patient is likely experiencing a tension pneumothorax. In this situation, the most appropriate immediate management step is needle decompression. This procedure involves inserting a needle into the chest cavity to release the trapped air, relieving the pressure on the lungs and heart, and stabilizing the patient's condition until further definitive treatment can be applied."}
{"question": "A 21-year-old college student presents with intermittent palpitations, fine tremor, warm extremities, and swollen lower legs after returning from a trip and partying with friends. She has a history of smoking, occasional marijuana use, and regular alcohol consumption. Her physical examination shows a pulse rate of 100/min and irregular, with a blood pressure of 140/85 mm Hg, and respiration rate of 25/min. Considering her symptoms and lifestyle factors, what is the most appropriate next step in management to investigate the underlying cause of her condition?", "gold_answer": "Given the symptoms of intermittent palpitations, fine tremor, warm extremities, and irregular heartbeat, alongside a lifestyle that includes smoking, marijuana use, and alcohol consumption, the signs strongly suggest a thyroid-related issue, particularly hyperthyroidism. The warm extremities, fine tremor, and increased heart rate align with an overactive thyroid gland, which could be driving these physiological changes.\n\nTo investigate this underlying cause properly, the most appropriate next step is to order thyroid function tests. Specifically, measuring the levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) will provide valuable insights into her thyroid function. These tests will help confirm or rule out hyperthyroidism and guide subsequent management based on the findings."}
{"question": "A 50-year-old man is interested in the impact of his weight on becoming healthier and understands the weight distribution for his age group. If the national average weight for males aged 50-59 years is 90 kg (200 lb) with a standard deviation of 27 kg (60 lb), what is the expected weight of a person who is 2 standard deviations above the mean?", "gold_answer": "The expected weight of a person who is 2 standard deviations above the mean for males aged 50-59 years, given a mean weight of 90 kg and a standard deviation of 27 kg, is 144 kg. This calculation involves adding 54 kg (which is 2 times the standard deviation of 27 kg) to the mean of 90 kg. Thus, if a 50-year-old man weighs 144 kg, he is at a weight that is 2 standard deviations above the average for his age group."}
{"question": "In considering the disease course of a 55-year-old caucasian man with a history of multiple neurological episodes including double vision, painful vision loss, arm weakness, and urinary retention, which specific feature of his clinical presentation is associated with a more benign prognosis?", "gold_answer": "The feature in this clinical presentation that is associated with a more benign prognosis is the painful vision loss, which likely represents optic neuritis. In the context of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), optic neuritis as an initial symptom is generally linked with a more favorable long-term outcome compared to initial presentations involving more severe motor or cerebellar symptoms."}
{"question": "A 3-year-old girl is presented with a 5-day history of high fever, fatigue, increased crying, decreased eating, and pain in her arms and legs. During examination, she has a high fever, ill appearance, and a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Her laboratory tests indicate leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, kidney dysfunction, protein in the urine, and the presence of rare red blood cell casts. With these clinical findings, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient to confirm the suspected diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Given the symptoms and laboratory findings in this 3-year-old girl, the clinical picture is concerning for a serious underlying condition, possibly infective endocarditis, especially with the presence of a new heart murmur and systemic signs of infection and inflammation. \n\nThe next most appropriate step in management is to obtain blood cultures. Blood cultures are crucial for diagnosing infective endocarditis as they can identify the specific pathogen causing the infection, allowing for targeted antimicrobial therapy. Early detection and treatment are important to prevent complications associated with endocarditis. Therefore, obtaining blood cultures is the best next step to confirm the suspected diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment."}
{"question": "A 25-year-old pregnant woman at 25 weeks' gestation presents with fever, right-sided flank pain, chills, nausea, vomiting, and dysuria. Her vital signs show a temperature of 39°C, pulse of 110/min, respirations of 20/min, and blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg. Examination reveals costovertebral angle tenderness on the right, with laboratory tests indicating significant leukocytosis and pyuria. Cultures are obtained. Based on this clinical presentation, what is the most appropriate next step in management?", "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation strongly suggests acute pyelonephritis, particularly considering the patient's pregnant state at 25 weeks' gestation. This condition is serious due to potential complications for both the mother and the fetus, such as preterm labor and sepsis. Immediate and effective management is crucial.\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management is to initiate intravenous antibiotics. This approach ensures rapid and sufficient blood levels of the antibiotic to control the infection, which is particularly important during pregnancy to protect both the mother and the developing fetus. Safety considerations during pregnancy typically favor antibiotics such as cephalosporins or penicillins. Therefore, starting intravenous antibiotics is the best course of action given the severity of the infection and the circumstances."}
{"question": "A 55-year-old man with a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension presents to the emergency department with crushing substernal chest pain. He was given aspirin and nitroglycerin en route and states that his pain is currently a 2/10. The patient’s initial echocardiogram (ECG) is within normal limits, and his first set of cardiac troponins is 0.10 ng/mL (reference range < 0.10 ng/mL). The patient is sent to the observation unit. The patient is given dipyridamole, which causes his chest pain to recur. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s current symptoms?\nA. Cardiac sarcoidosis\nB. Coronary steal\nC. Dislodged occlusive thrombus\nD. Stress induced cardiomyopathy\nE. Vasospastic vessel disease", "gold_answer": "The most likely etiology of the patient's recurrent chest pain after the administration of dipyridamole is B. Coronary steal. This phenomenon occurs when dipyridamole, a vasodilator used during stress testing, causes maximal dilation of healthy coronary vessels while areas with stenotic or blocked vessels cannot dilate further. This results in blood flow being \"stolen\" away from the regions supplied by the narrowed vessels, leading to ischemia and the recurrence of chest pain. This aligns well with the scenario described, where the recurrence of pain closely followed the administration of dipyridamole."}
{"question": "A 7-day-old infant presents with bilious vomiting, gross abdominal distention, and absent bowel sounds. An X-ray of the abdomen reveals multiple gas-filled loops. Based on these clinical findings and imaging results, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis for the 7-day-old infant is midgut volvulus. This condition involves the twisting of the intestines, which can lead to bowel obstruction and compromised blood supply. The presence of bilious vomiting, gross abdominal distention, absent bowel sounds, and the abdominal X-ray showing multiple gas-filled loops align well with this diagnosis. Midgut volvulus is a surgical emergency, requiring prompt intervention to prevent serious complications."}
{"question": "An 80 year old asymptomatic woman was detected to have a monoclonal spike on serum electrophoresis (IgG levels 1.5 g/dl). 1: one marrow revealed plasma cells of 8%. The most likely diagnosis is -\nA. Multiple myeloma\nB. Indolent myeloma\nC. Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance\nD. Waldenstorrn's macroglobulinemia", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 80-year-old asymptomatic woman with a monoclonal spike of 1.5 g/dl (IgG) and bone marrow plasma cells of 8% is C. Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). This condition is characterized by having a monoclonal protein level under 3 g/dl and less than 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow, which matches the details provided."}
{"question": "A 59-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of nausea and chronic abdominal pain that is worse after eating. She has Hashimoto thyroiditis. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. A biopsy specimen of the corpus of the stomach shows destruction of the upper glandular layer of the gastric mucosa and G-cell hyperplasia. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following conditions?\nA. Gastric adenocarcinoma\nB. Curling ulcer\nC. Aplastic anemia\nD. Gastric MALT lymphoma", "gold_answer": "A. Gastric adenocarcinoma\n\nThe information provided strongly suggests that this woman is experiencing autoimmune gastritis, a condition characterized by the destruction of gastric parietal cells, leading to chronic inflammation and atrophy of the stomach lining. This inflammation and the resultant changes in the stomach environment are known risk factors for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. Autoimmune gastritis is not typically associated with conditions like Curling ulcers, which are stress-induced, or aplastic anemia, which involves the bone marrow. Similarly, while gastric MALT lymphoma is often linked to chronic H. pylori infection, there is no mention of such an infection in this case. Given the biopsy findings and her autoimmune background, she is at the greatest risk for gastric adenocarcinoma."}
{"question": "A 68-year-old woman with burning during urination and a urinalysis showing numerous white cells and bacteria is being evaluated. She has no fever, chills, or back discomfort. What medical comorbidity is most commonly associated with her condition in this scenario?", "gold_answer": "In this scenario, the medical comorbidity most commonly associated with the urinary tract infection is diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is known to increase the risk of UTIs, especially in older individuals, due to factors such as high blood sugar levels that can impair the immune system and alter bladder function. Given the woman's age and the absence of more severe symptoms like fever or back pain, which could indicate a more extensive infection like pyelonephritis, diabetes stands out as a significant predisposing factor for the development of UTIs in this context."}
{"question": "When performing double screening ELISA tests on a population with low prevalence, what result is achieved in terms of specificity and predictive value?", "gold_answer": "When performing double screening with ELISA tests in a population where the prevalence of the disease is low, the specificity of the testing process increases. This is because the second round of testing helps to confirm true negatives and reduce false positives, leading to a more accurate identification of those who do not have the disease. \n\nHowever, the positive predictive value (PPV) does not improve correspondingly in a low prevalence scenario. The PPV is influenced by both the specificity of the test and the actual prevalence of the disease within the population. Since the disease is rare, even with high specificity, the number of false positives may still outnumber true positives, which results in a relatively low PPV. This essentially means that while double screening helps ensure that negative results are reliable, it does not guarantee that a positive result accurately confirms the disease's presence in individuals, due to the limited number of true cases to validate the positive predictions."}
{"question": "A 35-year-old male presents with a sudden onset of high-grade fever, and upon malarial slide examination, all stages of parasites are observed. The schizonts measure 20 microns in size and contain 14-20 merozoites per cell along with yellow-brown pigment. Based on these findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the malarial slide examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is an infection with Plasmodium vivax. The characteristics observed — the full range of parasite stages, the sizable schizonts measuring 20 microns, the 14-20 merozoites present per schizont, and the yellow-brown pigment — are consistent with Plasmodium vivax. Unlike other malarial parasites, Plasmodium vivax often displays these features in the peripheral blood, helping differentiate it from other species such as Plasmodium ovale or Plasmodium malariae. These observations align well with the typical presentation of Plasmodium vivax, making it the most probable cause of this malaria case."}
{"question": "A neurological examination of a 47-year-old woman reveals a normal corneal reflex in her right eye, but no consensual corneal reflex in her left eye. What additional neurological finding is most likely present, indicating an issue with an associated cranial nerve function?", "gold_answer": "The scenario described suggests an issue with the left facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). Given that the left eye does not exhibit a consensual blink when the right eye's cornea is stimulated, the problem likely lies in the motor pathway controlled by the left facial nerve, which is responsible for closing the eyelids.\n\nAn additional neurological finding that is most likely present due to this facial nerve dysfunction is weakness of the facial muscles on the left side. This can manifest as facial asymmetry, where there might be a droop in the corner of the mouth or difficulty in tightly closing the left eye.\n\nFurthermore, patients with facial nerve issues may experience hyperacusis on the affected side due to the nerve's role in innervating the stapedius muscle in the middle ear, which helps dampen loud sounds. So, in this case, the patient might find sounds excessively loud in their left ear. Both facial muscle weakness and hyperacusis fit the clinical picture of left-sided facial nerve dysfunction in the described case."}
{"question": "A 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, is at 38 weeks' gestation with regular painful contractions indicating the onset of labor. Her pregnancy has been complicated by gestational diabetes treated with insulin. On pelvic examination, her cervix is 50% effaced and 4 cm dilated, with the fetal vertex at -1 station. Ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Baseline fetal heart rate is 145/min with a variability of ≥ 15/min. During a 20-minute observation period, there are 7 uterine contractions, 4 accelerations, and 3 decelerations with a nadir occurring within half a minute that happen at differing intervals relative to the contractions. Given this information, what is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's labor?", "gold_answer": "Given the situation described, the best approach is to continue with close monitoring of both mother and baby. The patient is in the early part of active labor, progressing naturally, and the baby's heart rate pattern is largely reassuring. The variable decelerations, which are likely due to umbilical cord compression, are currently not accompanied by any concerning signs such as prolonged decelerations or reduced variability. Therefore, allowing labor to progress with regular monitoring is the appropriate next step."}
{"question": "In the event that a scooter rider is thrown off after being hit from behind, and they land with their head hitting the curb, complaining of severe neck pain and immobility, what is the appropriate way to stabilize and transport them safely to the hospital?", "gold_answer": "In the situation where a scooter rider has been hit and is experiencing severe neck pain and immobility after their head impacts with a curb, it's crucial to suspect a potential neck or spinal injury and proceed with extreme caution. Here are the appropriate steps to stabilize and transport the individual safely to the hospital:\n\n1. **Minimize Movement**: Avoid moving the rider unnecessarily. Keeping their neck and spine stable is paramount to prevent further injury. Reassure them to remain as still as possible.\n\n2. **Stabilize the Neck**: If a cervical collar is available, use it to immobilize the neck. If not, manually stabilize the head by placing your hands on either side, keeping it aligned with the spine. Do this gently but firmly, maintaining a neutral position.\n\n3. **Prepare for Transport**: Use a spinal board or a scoop stretcher to transfer the rider. Ensure that no additional movement is exerted on the neck and spine during this process. This typically requires a coordinated effort among several people to lift the rider smoothly and steadily onto the board.\n\n4. **Secure the Rider**: Once on the spinal board or stretcher, secure the rider using straps to prevent shifting during transport to the hospital.\n\n5. **Transport to Medical Facility**: Ensure the rider is transported promptly to a hospital for further examination and treatment. During transport, continuously monitor their vital signs and condition, ensuring their head and neck remain stable.\n\nThe main goal is to minimize any risk of exacerbating the injury while getting the individual the necessary medical attention as quickly and safely as possible."}
{"question": "An 85-year-old man presents with a sudden onset of severe occipital headache, vomiting, and double vision. He has a history of hypertension. His examination shows a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15/15, mild neck stiffness, and normal power in all limbs. Based on these clinical features, where is the likely site of the pathology causing these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical features presented, the symptoms likely stem from a pathology in the posterior circulation of the brain. The sudden onset of a severe occipital headache, along with vomiting, double vision, and mild neck stiffness, strongly suggests a subarachnoid hemorrhage, possibly due to an aneurysm in the posterior circulation. This area supplies the occipital lobes, brainstem, and cerebellum, and issues here can cause the symptoms described. Thus, a subarachnoid hemorrhage originating from an aneurysm near the brainstem in the posterior cerebral circulation is a likely cause."}
{"question": "What is the best management for a 32-week pregnant woman with mild uterine contraction, stable vitals, and placenta previa type III?", "gold_answer": "In managing a 32-week pregnant woman with mild uterine contractions, stable vitals, and type III placenta previa, the key focus is to prevent preterm labor while minimizing the risk of complications from the placenta previa.\n\n1. **Hospitalization and Monitoring**: The patient should be admitted to the hospital for continuous monitoring of both maternal and fetal well-being. This allows immediate intervention if her condition changes, such as increased contractions or any signs of bleeding.\n\n2. **Administration of Corticosteroids**: It's important to administer corticosteroids, like betamethasone, to accelerate fetal lung maturity. This is a proactive step should delivery become unavoidable.\n\n3. **Consideration of Tocolytics**: While tocolytics can be considered to delay labor, their use must be balanced against the risk of exacerbating bleeding associated with placenta previa. The decision should be based on careful evaluation by the medical team.\n\n4. **Avoid digital cervical examination**: Given the placenta previa, any digital examination should be avoided to prevent triggering bleeding.\n\nIn summary, the best management includes hospitalization for monitoring, administration of corticosteroids for fetal lung development, and a cautious approach to managing uterine contractions while being prepared to intervene should complications arise."}
{"question": "A young asymptomatic female is observed to have a Mid-systollic click on routine examination. Valves are likely to show\nA. Myxomatous degeneration\nB. Aschoff bodies\nC. Calcified degeneration\nD. Rupture chordae tendinae", "gold_answer": "The young asymptomatic female with a mid-systolic click on routine examination likely has mitral valve prolapse. This condition is often associated with myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leaflets, which causes them to be floppy and bulge back into the left atrium during systole, creating the distinctive click sound. Therefore, the valves are likely to show:\n\nA. Myxomatous degeneration"}
{"question": "At what age can the ELISA test reliably diagnose HIV infection in an infant born to an HIV-infected mother?", "gold_answer": "The ELISA test can reliably diagnose HIV infection in an infant born to an HIV-infected mother at around 18 months of age. Prior to this age, the presence of maternal HIV antibodies, which the infant acquires passively during pregnancy, can lead to false-positive results. Therefore, it's important to wait until those maternal antibodies have cleared before using the ELISA test for diagnosis. Before 18 months, more reliable diagnostic methods such as PCR tests, which detect the virus's genetic material, should be used to determine the infant’s actual HIV status."}
{"question": "A 50 years old male patient came to emergency with right hemiparesis and loss of speech for 2.5 hours. BP is 180/100. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?\nA. Give antitypeensive to control BP\nB. Aspirin 300 mg and anticogulants\nC. Administer t-plasinogen activator\nD. Go for NCCT", "gold_answer": "In the scenario provided, the patient's symptoms are highly indicative of an acute stroke, possibly ischemic, given the sudden onset of right-sided weakness and loss of speech. The elevated blood pressure is typical in acute stroke situations and should not be aggressively managed immediately unless it's extremely high. The priority is to determine the type of stroke because treatment varies significantly between ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.\n\nBefore administering any treatment such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which is used to treat ischemic strokes, or aspirin, a clear diagnosis needs to be established to rule out hemorrhagic stroke. The best immediate step in this management is obtaining a non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan of the brain. The NCCT is crucial to distinguish between an ischemic and a hemorrhagic stroke.\n\nTherefore, the next best step in the management of this patient is: \n\nD. Go for NCCT"}
{"question": "A 22-year-old female presents with gas, abdominal distention, and explosive diarrhea, all of which occur after eating cheese. She had a brief period of nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting earlier this year but fully recovered without treatment. Given the suspected diagnosis, what laboratory finding in her stool would most likely be characteristic of her condition?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms described—gas, abdominal distention, and explosive diarrhea following cheese consumption—it is likely that the young woman is experiencing lactose intolerance. This condition results from the inability to properly digest lactose due to a deficiency in the enzyme lactase. When lactose is not absorbed in the small intestine, it migrates to the colon, where bacteria ferment it, producing gas and acids.\n\nA key laboratory finding that would most likely be characteristic of lactose intolerance is a decreased pH of the stool. This reduced pH indicates acidity, which results from the fermentation byproducts of lactose by intestinal bacteria. Therefore, the low pH of the stool is a significant indicator of lactose intolerance and aligns with the symptoms and suspected diagnosis in this case."}

{"question": "A cardiologist wants to study the effect of an atorvastatin drug. He notes down the initial cholesterol levels of 50 patients and then administers the drug on them. After a month&;s treatment, he measures the cholesterol level again. Which of the following is the most appropriate to test the statistical significance of the change in blood cholesterol.\nA. Paired t-test\nB. Unpaired or independent t-test\nC. Analysis of variance\nD. Chi-square test", "gold_answer": "To determine whether there is a statistically significant change in cholesterol levels after administering atorvastatin to the same group of patients, the most appropriate test to use is the **Paired t-test** (Option A). This test is ideal for analyzing data where you have two sets of measurements taken from the same subjects before and after treatment, allowing you to assess if the mean difference is significant."}
{"question": "In the study of immunoglobulins that are transmitted across the placenta from mother to fetus, which specific immunological event is primarily facilitated by the structure responsible for complement activation?", "gold_answer": "The specific immunological event primarily facilitated by the structure responsible for complement activation is the classical complement pathway. During pregnancy, the immunoglobulins IgG1 and IgG3 that are efficiently transferred from mother to fetus across the placenta play key roles. IgG1, due to its more efficient placental transfer, becomes the primary driver of this complement activation in the fetus, providing essential immune protection against pathogens."}
{"question": "An 11-year-old boy presents with a history of thigh pain and swelling, and an X-ray shows an 'onion skin' appearance on the diaphysis of the femur. A PET scan reveals lung nodules, indicating potential malignancy. What specific genetic translocation is most associated with this condition?", "gold_answer": "The specific genetic translocation most associated with the condition you described, which is likely Ewing sarcoma, is t(11;22)(q24;q12). This translocation results in a fusion between the EWSR1 gene on chromosome 22 and the FLI1 gene on chromosome 11, serving as a key diagnostic marker for Ewing sarcoma."}
{"question": "A 10-year-old male child presents with pallor and a history of blood transfusion 2 months prior. The laboratory investigations show hemoglobin at 4.5 g/dL, a total leukocyte count of 60,000/µL, platelet count of 200,000/µL, with immunophenotyping results indicating CD10 positive, CD19 positive, CD117 positive, myeloperoxidase positive, and CD33 negative. What is the most probable diagnosis given these findings?", "gold_answer": "Based on the provided information, the most probable diagnosis for the 10-year-old male is Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia (MPAL). The combination of markers from both B-cell lineage (CD10 and CD19 positivity) and myeloid lineage (myeloperoxidase positivity, CD117 positivity) suggests a leukemic process that encompasses features of both lineages. Although CD33, another myeloid marker, is negative, MPAL can frequently present with unexpected immunophenotypic profiles. Therefore, the mixed presentation of these findings aligns well with MPAL."}
{"question": "In a neonate delivered at 32 weeks who is on a ventilator showing 'white out lung' on X-ray and an ABG with a PO2 of 75, with current ventilator settings of FiO2 at 70% and rate at 50 breaths per minute, what should be the next management step if the clinical situation does not worsen?", "gold_answer": "Given the scenario, the neonate is likely experiencing Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) due to surfactant deficiency, a common issue in premature infants. The 'white out lung' on the X-ray suggests collapsed alveoli or atelectasis, which is consistent with this condition.\n\nIn this situation, the most appropriate next management step, assuming the clinical status remains stable and does not worsen, is to consider administering exogenous surfactant. This intervention can significantly improve lung compliance, recruit collapsed alveoli, and potentially reduce the need for high oxygen concentrations and aggressive ventilator support. Surfactant therapy is a well-established treatment for RDS in premature infants and can lead to better respiratory outcomes.\n\nWhile increasing PEEP could be a consideration to help with alveolar recruitment and improve oxygenation, exogenous surfactant administration directly addresses the underlying problem in this scenario. Therefore, the priority should be to administer surfactant therapy to help stabilize the infant and improve lung function."}
{"question": "A 72-year-old woman presents with megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency attributed to her diet. What is the most likely dietary practice that could lead to this folate deficiency?", "gold_answer": "The most likely dietary practice leading to folate deficiency in this 72-year-old woman is overcooking her food. Folate is a heat-sensitive vitamin, and excessive cooking, particularly boiling, can significantly reduce folate content in food. This could be especially relevant if she frequently overcooks vegetables, which are a primary source of folate. This practice, combined with possible age-related dietary changes and a preference for convenience foods, might lead to inadequate intake of this crucial vitamin."}
{"question": "A 29-year-old male presents to the emergency department 20 minutes after being stabbed in the right chest, with stable vital signs and a knife still in place. Upon examination, vital signs indicate a pulse of 110/min, and oxygen saturation is at 97% on room air. Breath sounds are equal, and there is no neck crepitus or evidence of pneumothorax. What is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient?", "gold_answer": "In this scenario, the most appropriate next step in management is to ensure the knife remains securely in place to prevent any potential exacerbation of injury. Since the patient is currently stable, the focus should be on preventing movement of the knife to mitigate further harm. Concurrently, consulting with a trauma surgeon is crucial, as they are best equipped to evaluate the extent of the injury and determine if surgical intervention is necessary. This plan allows for a careful assessment of the patient's condition without rushing into action that could inadvertently worsen the situation."}

Left coronary aery\nC. Posterior interventricular aery\nD. Marginal aery", "gold_answer": "Given the details, the blockage causing the concern is most likely in the left coronary artery. This artery is responsible for supplying blood to the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which, in turn, supplies the anterior two-thirds of the interventricular septum. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Left coronary artery"}
{"question": "What is the most common immunoglobulin deficiency in children who experience frequent chest infections, as indicated by serological examination?", "gold_answer": "The most common immunoglobulin deficiency in children who experience frequent chest infections, as indicated by serological examination, is IgA deficiency. This condition is prevalent among primary immunodeficiencies and is associated with an increased susceptibility to infections, particularly those affecting the respiratory tract due to the role of IgA in protecting mucous membranes."}
{"question": "A neonate is presenting with respiratory distress, marked chest and xiphoid retractions with inspiratory lag, and minimal nasal flaring. Grunting is audible with the help of a stethoscope. What is the Silverman Anderson score for this clinical presentation?", "gold_answer": "Given the clinical presentation of the neonate with respiratory distress, here's a breakdown of the Silverman Anderson score components:\n\n1. **Upper Chest Movement**: The description of 'marked chest retractions' indicates there is intercostal retraction and inspiratory lag, which aligns with a score of 1.\n   \n2. **Lower Chest Retraction**: The marked retractions suggest a moderate to severe issue, generally scoring this as 2.\n   \n3. **Xiphoid Retraction**: The specific mention of 'xiphoid retractions' indicates noticeable movement, corresponding to a score of 2.\n   \n4. **Nasal Flaring**: The 'minimal nasal flaring' points to its presence but a less pronounced severity, which would score 1.\n   \n5. **Grunting**: Grunting is described as audible with the help of a stethoscope, leading to a score of 1.\n\nSumming these points (1 for upper chest movement, 2 for lower chest retraction, 2 for xiphoid retraction, 1 for nasal flaring, and 1 for grunting), the total Silverman Anderson score is 7.\n\nTherefore, the Silverman Anderson score for this neonate is **7**, indicating significant respiratory distress."}
{"question": "What is the most appropriate management strategy for a patient with Barrett's oesophagus confirmed by endoscopic biopsy?", "gold_answer": "The management of Barrett's oesophagus depends primarily on whether dysplasia is present and its severity. \n\n1. **Without Dysplasia**: If no dysplasia is detected, the focus is on regular surveillance and acid suppression. Surveillance typically involves endoscopic exams every 3-5 years to monitor any changes in the esophagus lining. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are usually prescribed to control gastroesophageal reflux, thereby minimizing further damage and potential progression.\n\n2. **With Dysplasia**:\n   - **Low-Grade Dysplasia**: More frequent endoscopic surveillance is advised, such as every 6-12 months. Endoscopic therapeutic options like radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may also be considered to remove dysplastic tissue and reduce the risk of progression to cancer.\n   - **High-Grade Dysplasia**: This calls for more aggressive treatment due to the significant risk of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic options like RFA or endoscopic mucosal resection are recommended to remove dysplastic areas. In some cases, esophagectomy may be considered, though it is typically reserved for cases where endoscopic treatments are not viable or fail.\n\n3. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Across all cases, lifestyle changes such as weight management, dietary adjustments, and avoiding smoking and alcohol are important to reduce reflux symptoms and the risk of progression.\n\nIn summary, the management of Barrett's oesophagus involves a combination of surveillance, medical therapy with PPIs, potential endoscopic intervention depending on the presence and grade of dysplasia, and lifestyle modifications to manage acid reflux and reduce cancer risk."}
{"question": "A 34-year-old female presents with symptoms including fever, nausea, vomiting, and severe left flank pain. Her examination reveals an elevated body temperature and costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis and urine microscopy suggest an acute kidney issue. What histological finding is expected in the kidneys of this patient?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms described and clinical examination, this patient's presentation is highly indicative of acute pyelonephritis, which is a type of kidney infection. In cases of acute pyelonephritis, one of the hallmark histological findings in the kidney tissue is the infiltration of neutrophils.\n\nHistologically, you would expect to see neutrophils infiltrating the renal interstitium and potentially the tubules. This influx of neutrophils is part of the body’s immune response to the bacterial infection, leading to an acute inflammatory process. The presence of neutrophils in these areas is a clear indicator of the body's attempt to combat the infection, consistent with the symptoms of fever, flank pain, and tenderness."}
{"question": "When comparing mortality rates between two countries, why is it necessary to apply direct standardization?", "gold_answer": "When comparing mortality rates between two countries, applying direct standardization is necessary to account for differences in their population age structures. This method adjusts the crude mortality rates to a common standard population, thereby eliminating age-related biases that can distort comparisons. Without standardization, a country with a higher proportion of elderly people might appear to have a higher mortality rate, not due to poorer health conditions, but simply because older populations naturally experience higher mortality. Direct standardization provides a more accurate and fair comparison, reflecting true differences in health status between countries without the skewing effects of age distribution. This approach is widely used by epidemiologists and statisticians for its reliability in delivering unbiased insights."}
{"question": "In a 67-year-old male smoker presenting with hemoptysis and cough, a bronchoscopic biopsy reveals an undifferentiated tumor. Which immunohistochemical marker is most helpful for diagnosing this condition?", "gold_answer": "In the scenario described, the most helpful immunohistochemical marker for diagnosing the condition, particularly given the likelihood of small cell lung carcinoma in a smoker, is TTF-1 (Thyroid Transcription Factor-1). TTF-1 is highly specific for lung tissue and is commonly expressed in primary lung cancers, including small cell lung carcinoma. Its presence would strongly suggest that the tumor originated in the lung, making it a crucial marker for this diagnosis."}
{"question": "In the case of a 5-year-old girl with E. coli pyelonephritis who remains febrile after 4 days of appropriate antibiotic treatment, and imaging reveals a wedge-shaped area in the kidney with minimal contrast enhancement but no abscess, what is the appropriate management step?", "gold_answer": "In this situation, the appropriate management step is to continue providing supportive care while closely monitoring the child’s response. This includes ensuring she is on the correct antibiotics, as determined by culture and sensitivity testing, and maintaining hydration and pain management. Given the imaging findings of a wedge-shaped area with minimal contrast enhancement, it's prudent to consider potential complications such as renal ischemia or inflammation, which could be contributing to the delayed response.\n\nIt’s essential to verify that she is indeed receiving appropriate antibiotics tailored to the sensitivity profile of the E. coli strain. If there’s any doubt about resistance or antibiotic choice, reassessing and possibly consulting with infectious disease specialists might be warranted.\n\nAdditionally, since there is no abscess or significant structural abnormality, invasive interventions like surgery are not indicated at this time. However, if she does not show signs of improvement in the next few days, further evaluation, including repeat imaging or additional blood work, may be necessary to reassess kidney function and the inflammation’s evolution. This conservative and supportive approach is typically effective unless new symptoms or findings suggest a change in management strategy."}

{"question": "A 62-year-old man presents with nocturia, a weak urinary stream, and a firm nodule detected in the right posterior lobe of his prostate during a digital rectal examination. His PSA level is elevated at 6.5 ng/mL. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient considering these findings?", "gold_answer": "Given the findings of a firm nodule on the prostate and an elevated PSA level of 6.5 ng/mL in a 62-year-old man, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a prostate biopsy. The combination of a palpable nodule in the prostate, especially in the posterior lobe, and elevated PSA levels increases the suspicion for prostate cancer. A biopsy will provide tissue samples that can be examined to determine the presence or absence of cancer, and if present, assess the aggressiveness of the cancer. This step is crucial for establishing a definitive diagnosis and guiding further treatment planning."}
{"question": "In a 30-week twin gestation with monochorionic diamniotic placentation where Twin B has oligohydramnios and is significantly smaller than Twin A, which potential condition is not a concern for Twin A?", "gold_answer": "In a 30-week twin gestation with monochorionic diamniotic twins, where Twin B has oligohydramnios and is significantly smaller, the primary concern often involves Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS). In this scenario, Twin A, being the larger twin, is typically the recipient twin in TTTS. Therefore, Twin A is usually more concerned with issues such as polyhydramnios (excessive amniotic fluid) due to the increased blood and fluid volume it receives. \n\nOn the other hand, Twin A is not typically at risk for oligohydramnios as this condition usually affects the donor twin (Twin B) in TTTS situations. Thus, oligohydramnios is not a concern for Twin A in this context."}
{"question": "A 60-year-old man presents with left-sided ptosis, unequal but reactive pupils, and has long-term smoking history. Notably, when measured in dim light, his left pupil is 3 mm and his right pupil is 5 mm. He also experiences left shoulder and arm pain. What is the most likely cause of his ophthalmologic symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms you're describing—left-sided ptosis (droopy eyelid), unequal reactive pupils with the left pupil being smaller in dim light, and shoulder and arm pain—strongly suggest Horner's syndrome. Horner's syndrome is characterized by ptosis, miosis (constricted pupil), and sometimes anhidrosis (lack of sweating) on one side of the face, and it occurs due to disruption of the sympathetic pathways.\n\nGiven the patient's long-term smoking history and the additional symptom of left shoulder and arm pain, a Pancoast tumor is a probable underlying cause. Pancoast tumors are a type of lung cancer located at the apex (top) of the lung that can invade and compress nearby structures, including the sympathetic nerve pathways running to the eye, leading to Horner's syndrome. Additionally, these tumors can invade the brachial plexus, potentially causing shoulder and arm pain.\n\nTherefore, considering the combination of the man's smoking history, ophthalmological and neurological symptoms, the most likely cause of his symptoms is a Pancoast tumor affecting the sympathetic nerve pathway."}

The significantly prolonged QT interval and frequent fainting episodes align with this diagnosis, making it a likely explanation for the patient's symptoms."}
{"question": "A 25-year-old man comes to the physician because of headache, dizziness, and bilateral leg claudication, Physical examination shows hypertension in the upper limbs and hypotension in the lower limbs. \n\nWhich of the following additional findings is mostly likely in this patient?\nA. Aortic valvular stenosis\nB. Notching of inferior margins of ribs\nC. Patent ductus arteriosus\nD. Vasculitis involving the aortic arch", "gold_answer": "The scenario described suggests a condition known as aortic coarctation, which is a narrowing of the aorta usually occurring just after the vessels that supply blood to the arms have branched off. This condition leads to higher blood pressure in the upper body and lower blood pressure in the lower body, explaining the man's symptoms of hypertension in the arms, hypotension in the legs, and leg claudication.\n\nA classic radiographic finding in this condition, due to collateral circulation, is notching of the inferior margins of the ribs. The intercostal arteries, which enlarge and become tortuous as they compensate for the narrowed aorta, can erode the ribs over time, leading to this characteristic rib notching.\n\nThus, the additional finding most likely in this patient is:\n\nB. Notching of inferior margins of ribs"}
{"question": "A patient presents with lesions over the axilla, groin, and trunk, characterized by central clearing and a progressive, papulovesicular margin. What is the preferred diagnostic test to confirm the likely diagnosis in this clinical scenario?", "gold_answer": "The preferred diagnostic test to confirm the likely diagnosis of a fungal infection like tinea corporis (ringworm), given the described skin lesions, is a KOH (potassium hydroxide) preparation. This test involves scraping a sample from the edge of the lesion, applying potassium hydroxide, and examining it under a microscope to look for fungal hyphae. It's a quick and effective method used in clinical settings to confirm the presence of dermatophyte infections."}
{"question": "In a neonate presenting with heart failure, bulging anterior fontanelle, and a cranial bruit, and where CT angiography indicates a vascular abnormality, which vessel is predominantly involved in this condition?", "gold_answer": "In a neonate presenting with heart failure, a bulging anterior fontanelle, and a cranial bruit, the condition likely involves a Vein of Galen malformation. This condition is characterized by an arteriovenous malformation where there is an abnormal connection between cerebral arteries and the median prosencephalic vein, historically referred to as the Vein of Galen. Although it is an arteriovenous shunt, the condition is primarily associated with the Vein of Galen, which is the vessel predominantly involved and gives the condition its name."}

Days 90-birth", "gold_answer": "The defect responsible for this patient's symptoms, such as the bony defect in the spine with the protrusion of a membrane and associated motor and sensory deficits, is indicative of a neural tube defect like spina bifida. Neural tube defects occur due to improper closure of the neural tube during embryonic development. This crucial process happens early in pregnancy, specifically between days 21 and 35 of embryonic development. Thus, the neural tube defect leading to this patient's symptoms most likely occurred during this timeframe. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Days 21-35"}
{"question": "Shortly after delivery, a female newborn develops bluish discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes. She was born at term to a 38-year-old primigravid woman. Pregnancy was complicated by maternal diabetes mellitus. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 81%. Echocardiography shows immediate bifurcation of the vessel arising from the left ventricle; the vessel emerging from the right ventricle gives out coronary, head, and neck vessels. An abnormality in which of the following developmental processes most likely accounts for this patient's condition?\nA. Separation of tricuspid valve tissue from myocardium\nB. Fusion of endocardial cushion\nC. Alignment of infundibular septum\nD. Division of aorta and pulmonary artery\nE. Spiraling of aorticopulmonary septum", "gold_answer": "The newborn's presentation is indicative of a congenital heart defect, likely related to the misalignment or improper division of the heart's outflow tracts. Given the echocardiogram findings and the symptoms of cyanosis and low oxygen saturation, the spiraling of the aorticopulmonary septum is a critical developmental process that could explain these abnormalities.\n\nDuring normal heart development, the aorticopulmonary septum spirals to ensure that the aorta and pulmonary artery are properly aligned with the left and right ventricles, respectively. A defect in this spiraling can lead to transposition of the great arteries or other similar defects, where the aorta and pulmonary artery are not correctly connected, resulting in the circulation of oxygen-poor blood.\n\nThus, the most likely developmental abnormality accounting for this patient's condition is an issue with the \"spiraling of the aorticopulmonary septum.\"\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE.

He has a papular lesion on the back of his hand and recently had contact with a feline animal shelter. Given these symptoms and history, what is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and history described for this 5-year-old boy are highly suggestive of cat scratch disease, which is caused by the bacteria Bartonella henselae. The key indicators are the prolonged fever, significant lymphadenopathy, contact with cats, and the papular lesion likely resulting from a scratch or bite.\n\nIn most cases of cat scratch disease, especially in children who are generally healthy, the condition is self-limiting and might resolve without specific treatment. However, given this child has been experiencing persistent symptoms like recurring fever and debilitating lymphadenopathy for several weeks, it is prudent to initiate treatment to alleviate symptoms and mitigate the bacterial infection.\n\nAzithromycin is typically used as an antibiotic treatment in more severe or persistent cases of cat scratch disease. It helps by reducing the bacterial load and aiding in the resolution of symptoms. Therefore, in this scenario, prescribing azithromycin would be the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition."}
{"question": "In a 42-year-old male undergoing elective hernioplasty, an increased end tidal carbon dioxide (ETC02) level, abdominal wall rigidity, tachycardia, tachypnea, mixed acidosis on blood gas analysis, and a serum lactate level of 3.4 mmol/L are observed. What is the most likely diagnosis that explains this clinical presentation?", "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation described—consisting of increased end tidal carbon dioxide, abdominal wall rigidity, tachycardia, tachypnea, mixed acidosis on blood gas analysis, and elevated serum lactate—strongly suggests malignant hyperthermia. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare but life-threatening condition typically triggered by certain anesthetic agents used during surgical procedures. It leads to a hypermetabolic state, increased carbon dioxide production, muscle rigidity, and a variety of systemic responses. This diagnosis aligns well with the acute onset of symptoms observed in this patient during anesthesia for hernia repair."}
{"question": "A 61-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug use and hepatitis C presents with fatigue, weight loss, and a nodular liver. The physical examination reveals scleral icterus and telangiectasias on the abdomen, with laboratory studies showing anemia and normal platelet counts. What additional laboratory finding is most indicative of the underlying liver pathology in this patient?", "gold_answer": "In this patient, given the history of hepatitis C and symptoms suggestive of cirrhosis, the most indicative laboratory finding of the underlying liver pathology would be an elevated prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR). This test evaluates the liver's synthetic ability to produce clotting factors, and an elevation suggests significant impairment of liver function, characteristic of advanced liver disease or cirrhosis. While alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are relevant in assessing the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a concern in patients with hepatitis C, the PT/INR directly reflects the liver's functional status in cirrhosis. Therefore, discovering an elevated PT/INR would provide crucial insight into the extent of liver pathology the patient is experiencing."}
{"question": "A 73-year-old man presents with worsening bilateral lower extremity pain that begins after walking, radiates down the buttocks, and is relieved by sitting and leaning forward. Given his history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, and vascular surgery, along with reduced sensation in the feet and degenerative changes seen in spinal X-rays, what is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing the cause of his symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The most appropriate next step in diagnosing the cause of this patient’s symptoms is **an MRI of the lumbar spine**.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe patient’s presentation—bilateral lower extremity pain triggered by walking, radiating from the buttocks, and relieved by sitting or leaning forward—is highly suggestive of **neurogenic claudication**, most commonly caused by **lumbar spinal stenosis**. This positional relief (leaning forward) is a hallmark of spinal stenosis, as it temporarily widens the spinal canal, reducing nerve root compression.\n\nWhile the patient’s history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and vascular surgery does increase his risk for **vascular claudication**, this condition is less likely because:\n1. Pain relief in vascular claudication typically occurs with rest and is not dependent on posture (sitting or leaning forward wouldn’t matter).\n2. Reduced sensation in the feet and degenerative changes on spinal X-rays point more toward a nerve-related etiology.\n\n### Why MRI?\n- While X-rays can identify degenerative changes, they are insufficient to assess the spinal canal, nerve roots, or soft tissues.\n- MRI provides detailed imaging of the spinal canal, nerve roots, and surrounding structures, making it the gold standard for diagnosing spinal stenosis.\n\nIn summary, given the clinical presentation and supportive findings, **an MRI of the lumbar spine** is the most logical and effective next step to confirm the diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis and guide further management."}
{"question": "In histological sections of the lung stained with routine H&E, what is the most common cause of the alveoli being filled with pale, nongranular pink fluid with no leukocytes or erythrocytes present?", "gold_answer": "The most common cause of alveoli being filled with pale, nongranular pink fluid without the presence of leukocytes or erythrocytes in histological sections of the lung stained with H&E is cardiogenic pulmonary edema, often due to heart failure. This occurs because of increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries, leading to the leakage of protein-rich transudate into the alveolar spaces without significant accompanying inflammatory cells or hemorrhage."}
{"question": "A 12-month-old boy has been brought to the physician with a urinalysis showing 3+ reducing substances but is otherwise healthy. When considering his metabolic condition, what specific enzyme activity will increase when he is given apple juice to drink compared to a healthy infant?", "gold_answer": "In this scenario, the 12-month-old boy is exhibiting high levels of reducing substances in his urine, suggesting an issue with metabolizing certain sugars, notably fructose. The condition described aligns with essential fructosuria, where the enzyme fructokinase is deficient or not functioning correctly. \n\nWhen he consumes apple juice, which is high in fructose, his body relies on an alternative metabolic pathway because fructokinase cannot perform its usual function of converting fructose to fructose-1-phosphate. Another enzyme, hexokinase, steps in to metabolize the fructose. Unlike fructokinase, hexokinase converts fructose to fructose-6-phosphate. Although this is not the primary pathway for fructose metabolism, it serves as a backup. \n\nTherefore, in this child with suspected essential fructosuria, the activity of hexokinase will increase when he is given apple juice compared to a healthy infant."}
{"question": "At what altitude is rapid ascent required for an otherwise healthy person from sea level to develop an alveolar PO2 of 60 mm Hg and experience high altitude illness?", "gold_answer": "An altitude of around 3,000 meters (approximately 10,000 feet) is where an otherwise healthy person can rapidly ascend and experience an alveolar PO2 of about 60 mm Hg, potentially leading to high altitude illness. This is generally the altitude where the oxygen levels begin to significantly drop, and the symptoms of altitude sickness, such as headaches and nausea, can occur due to the decreased availability of oxygen in the body."}
{"question": "True about Hepatocellular carcinoma -a) Most common tumor of liverb) Resectable only in 1% casesc) >70% of cases shows -↑ed AFPd) USG guided aspiration biopsy is used for diagnosis\nA. ab\nB. bc\nC. cd\nD. ac", "gold_answer": "Based on the analysis:\n\n- **Option c:** In more than 70% of cases, elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are indeed a common marker associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. This statement is accurate and aligns with the understanding of the disease.\n\n- **Option d:** While imaging techniques like CT or MRI are preferred, ultrasound-guided aspiration biopsy is occasionally used, especially when imaging results are inconclusive. So, this statement also holds true as it represents a valid diagnostic approach in certain scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. cd**."}
{"question": "A 65-year-old patient with a history of COPD and open-angle glaucoma in the left eye has had uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) for the last few months and is using latanoprost eye drops. Her ophthalmologist adds another eye drop to her regimen to further decrease her IOP. A week later, she returns with persistent dim vision, a small fixed pupil in her left eye, and a visual acuity of 20/40 compared to 20/20 in the right eye. What is the mechanism of action of the new medication that is most likely responsible for these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms described—dim vision, a small fixed pupil, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye—are characteristic of the effects of miotic agents, such as pilocarpine. Pilocarpine, a commonly used miotic in glaucoma treatment, works by stimulating muscarinic receptors, particularly the M3 receptors on the iris sphincter muscle, leading to pupil constriction (miosis). This constricted pupil allows less light into the eye, thus causing dim vision. Additionally, pilocarpine can increase the eye's accommodative demand, potentially affecting visual acuity.\n\nTherefore, the mechanism of action of the new medication likely responsible for these symptoms is the stimulation of muscarinic receptors, specifically leading to miosis."}
{"question": "A 10 year old boy presents with a palpable abdominal mass and imaging shows enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes. Biopsy reveals a starry sky appearance. What underlying genetic abnormality is most likely responsible for these findings?", "gold_answer": "The findings you’ve described in the 10-year-old boy, specifically an abdominal mass with a biopsy showing a \"starry sky\" appearance, strongly suggest Burkitt lymphoma. This type of lymphoma is characterized by rapid cell proliferation and often involves the abdomen in its sporadic form, which fits the clinical picture presented.\n\nBurkitt lymphoma is indeed associated with a specific genetic abnormality, which is a chromosomal translocation. The most common and characteristic translocation for Burkitt lymphoma is t(8;14). This translocation involves the MYC gene on chromosome 8 being placed next to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. This rearrangement results in the overexpression of the MYC oncogene, driving the aggressive cell growth observed in Burkitt lymphoma.\n\nTherefore, the underlying genetic abnormality most likely responsible for the findings in this boy is the t(8;14) translocation involving the MYC gene."}
{"question": "A 4-year-old boy who recently emigrated from Nigeria presents with an erythematous rash with fine yellow scales on his eyebrows and nasolabial folds, an erythematous throat, swollen tongue, peeling and fissures of the skin at the corners of the mouth, and a hemoglobin concentration of 9.6 g/dL. An erythrocyte glutathione reductase assay shows increased activity. Based on these findings, the patient is likely deficient in a vitamin that is a precursor to which molecule?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the 4-year-old boy is likely deficient in vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin. Riboflavin is a precursor to the molecules flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are essential cofactors in various biochemical reactions, including those involved in energy production and redox reactions within cells. The increased activity in the erythrocyte glutathione reductase assay supports this diagnosis, as riboflavin deficiency leads to altered enzyme activity. Thus, the vitamin the patient is likely deficient in is riboflavin, a precursor to FMN and FAD."}
{"question": "What is a naturally occurring radioactive substance found in small quantities in the human body?", "gold_answer": "A naturally occurring radioactive substance found in small quantities in the human body is potassium-40. Potassium is essential for various biological functions, and a small portion of it exists as potassium-40, contributing to the body's natural radioactivity."}
{"question": "A 35-year-old man is brought to the trauma bay with a gunshot wound to his right arm. He cannot move or feel his hand, specifically unable to extend his wrist or fingers, and lacks sensation to the first dorsal web space, although he maintains most sensation on the volar surface and can still clench his hand. Given these symptoms, which specific nerve is most likely injured?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms you've described strongly indicate an injury to the radial nerve. The inability to extend the wrist and fingers, combined with the loss of sensation in the first dorsal web space, aligns with radial nerve dysfunction. Moreover, maintaining the ability to clench the hand and retaining sensation on the volar (palm) side of the hand suggest that the median and ulnar nerves are intact, further pointing to an isolated injury to the radial nerve. This type of injury is consistent with the symptoms observed, typically occurring proximal to the wrist extensor muscle branches but distal to the triceps innervation. Therefore, in this scenario, the radial nerve is most likely injured."}
{"question": "When a person changes position from lying down to standing, there is an initial drop in blood pressure of 10 mm Hg, followed by a recovery of 8 mm Hg, leaving a net change of 2 mm Hg. What is the gain of the baroreceptor system in controlling blood pressure based on this scenario?", "gold_answer": "The gain of the baroreceptor system, in this scenario, is calculated based on the amount of correction achieved by the system relative to the remaining error. Initially, there is a 10 mm Hg drop in blood pressure. The baroreceptor system successfully recovers 8 mm Hg of this drop, leaving a net change of 2 mm Hg not corrected.\n\nThe gain, therefore, is determined by dividing the correction by the remaining change (error). This can be expressed as:\n\nGain = Recovery / Remaining Error = 8 mm Hg / 2 mm Hg = 4\n\nThus, the gain of the baroreceptor system in controlling blood pressure in this situation is 4, indicating its strong corrective capability in response to positional changes."}
{"question": "What combination of muscle fiber types is best suited for activities that involve brief high-intensity exercise?", "gold_answer": "For activities that involve brief high-intensity exercise, the best-suited muscle fiber types are the Type IIb fast-twitch fibers. These fibers are designed for quick, explosive movements and can generate a significant amount of force in a short period. They primarily rely on anaerobic metabolism, which allows them to perform these brief, intense exercises effectively, even though they fatigue more quickly compared to other fiber types. If success in sports like sprinting or weightlifting is your goal, having a higher proportion of Type IIb muscle fibers would provide the necessary power and speed for optimal performance in short-duration, high-intensity activities."}
{"question": "For which condition is hormone replacement therapy not considered useful in a 49-year-old female?", "gold_answer": "Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is primarily used for addressing menopause-related symptoms, such as hot flashes, night sweats, and to some degree, osteoporosis prevention. However, it is not considered useful and may even be risky for someone with heart disease. In fact, HRT is generally not recommended for preventing or treating heart disease due to potential cardiovascular risks. Therefore, HRT would not be considered useful in a 49-year-old female specifically for heart disease."}
{"question": "A 5-year-old boy presents with pubic hair development, increased height, pigmentation of genitalia, phallic enlargement, and a blood pressure of 130/90 mm Hg. What hormone measurement is most likely to be diagnostic in this clinical scenario?", "gold_answer": "In this clinical scenario, the boy's symptoms suggest a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), likely 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. This condition is characterized by early onset of puberty-like characteristics (such as pubic hair development and phallic enlargement) combined with hypertension. The hypertension arises due to the accumulation of 11-deoxycorticosterone, which possesses mineralocorticoid activity and thus raises blood pressure.\n\nTo confirm this diagnosis, measuring the level of 11-deoxycortisol in the blood would be most diagnostic. In 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, there is a buildup of 11-deoxycortisol due to the enzyme defect that prevents its conversion to cortisol. Therefore, an elevated level of 11-deoxycortisol would support the diagnosis of 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency in this boy."}
{"question": "A 7-year-old girl has experienced a non-productive cough and mild stridor for 3 months. She was improving, but then developed wheezing, a productive cough, mild fever, and hyperlucency on her chest X-ray. Pulmonary function tests show an obstructive pattern. What is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 7-year-old girl, given the symptoms of a persistent cough, mild stridor, evolving to wheezing, productive cough, mild fever, and hyperlucency on her chest X-ray, along with the obstructive pattern on pulmonary function tests, is post-viral bronchiolitis obliterans. This condition involves airway obstruction following a viral infection, leading to air trapping and hyperlucency seen on imaging, which aligns well with the clinical presentation."}
{"question": "A 27-year-old G1P0 woman at 25 weeks estimated gestational age experienced a significant increase in blood pressure and was treated with an intravenous antihypertensive medication. She later developed joint pain and had a positive blood test for anti-histone antibodies. Describe the mechanism of action of the intravenous antihypertensive medication most likely used in this patient.", "gold_answer": "Given the scenario, the intravenous antihypertensive medication most likely used in this patient is hydralazine. Hydralazine is a direct vasodilator, which works by relaxing smooth muscles in the blood vessel walls, particularly affecting arterioles. This leads to decreased systemic vascular resistance and subsequently lowers blood pressure. Additionally, hydralazine is known for its potential to cause drug-induced lupus erythematosus, characterized by symptoms like joint pain and the presence of anti-histone antibodies, matching the patient's clinical presentation."}
{"question": "Regarding the temporomandibular joint, which statements are true or false: Is the temporomandibular joint a synovial joint? Is the articular disc a remnant of the tendon of the medial pterygoid? Do gliding movements occur in the lower compartment and rotatory movements occur in the upper compartment? Is the joint capsule thick and tight in the lower part and loose and lax in the upper part? Does the sphenomandibular ligament act as a false support to the joint and attach to the angle of the mandible?", "gold_answer": "Regarding the temporomandibular joint, let's assess the statements:\n\n1. Is the temporomandibular joint a synovial joint?  \n   - **True:** The TMJ is indeed a synovial joint.\n\n2. Is the articular disc a remnant of the tendon of the medial pterygoid?  \n   - **False:** The articular disc is not a remnant of the tendon of the medial pterygoid muscle; it is a separate fibrocartilaginous structure.\n\n3. Do gliding movements occur in the lower compartment and rotatory movements occur in the upper compartment?  \n   - **False:** Gliding movements occur in the upper compartment, while rotatory (hinging) movements occur in the lower compartment of the TMJ.\n\n4. Is the joint capsule thick and tight in the lower part and loose and lax in the upper part?  \n   - **True:** The joint capsule is tighter around the lower part, aiding in rotational movements, and looser in the upper part to facilitate gliding movements.\n\n5. Does the sphenomandibular ligament act as a false support to the joint and attach to the angle of the mandible?  \n   - **False:** The sphenomandibular ligament does not attach to the angle of the mandible; it extends from the sphenoid bone to the lingula of the mandibular foramen and does not directly support the TMJ."}
{"question": "A 20-year-old male has been experiencing jaundice for 2 weeks. His liver function tests show serum bilirubin at 0.9 mg/dL, SGOT/SGPT levels at 1240/1450 IU. Testing positive for HBsAg and IgM anti-HEY antibodies, and negative for IgM anti-HBc, what is the most likely diagnosis considering these serological findings?", "gold_answer": "Based on the serological findings and liver function tests, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is an acute hepatitis E infection in the context of being a hepatitis B carrier. The positive HBsAg indicates the patient has hepatitis B surface antigen in his blood, indicating he is either a carrier or has a chronic infection. However, the presence of IgM anti-HEY antibodies points to a recent or ongoing hepatitis E infection, which aligns with his 2-week history of jaundice and elevated liver enzymes (SGOT/SGPT levels). The negative IgM anti-HBc suggests there is no recent acute hepatitis B infection. Therefore, the combination of symptoms and test results most strongly supports the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E superimposed on a chronic hepatitis B carrier state."}
{"question": "In a functional radical dissection of the neck, which structures are typically preserved?", "gold_answer": "In a functional radical dissection of the neck, the aim is to remove all necessary lymphatic tissue while preserving key anatomical structures to maintain as much function and appearance as possible. Typically, the structures that are preserved include the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein, and the spinal accessory nerve. These structures are crucial for maintaining shoulder functionality and preventing significant postoperative deformity. This approach balances effective cancer treatment with the preservation of quality of life."}
{"question": "A patient presents with arthralgia, a rash, lymphadenopathy, and pneumonia but does not have a fever. What disease is most likely indicated by these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms of arthralgia (joint pain), rash, lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), and pneumonia without the presence of fever, the most likely diagnosis is sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that commonly affects the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin, and can present without a fever. The absence of fever differentiates it from many infectious causes, and it aligns well with the symptom set described. While other conditions like Valley Fever (coccidioidomycosis) should be considered if there is relevant travel history, sarcoidosis stands out as the most plausible diagnosis given the provided symptoms."}
{"question": "A 74-year-old woman suffered an acute myocardial infarction due to occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. After 4 weeks, what pathological change would you expect to observe in the affected heart muscle?", "gold_answer": "After 4 weeks following an acute myocardial infarction caused by the occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, you would expect to observe dense fibrous scar tissue in the affected heart muscle. Initially, the area experiences cell death and inflammation, followed by the formation of granulation tissue as part of the healing process. By the four-week mark, this granulation tissue is largely replaced by collagen-rich scar tissue, which serves to provide structural support, although it lacks the contractile function of the original heart muscle."}

Nifedipine", "gold_answer": "The anti-hypertensive agent of choice for a patient with hypertension and aortic dissection is: \n\nA. Sodium nitroprusside\n\nSodium nitroprusside is effective in rapidly lowering blood pressure, which is crucial in the acute management of an aortic dissection to prevent further tearing. However, care must be taken to manage any potential reflex tachycardia, often by using it in conjunction with a beta-blocker."}
{"question": "Identify the organism responsible for causing intra-abdominal sepsis in a 45-year-old patient, considering that the organism is resistant to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ampicillin, can grow in the presence of 6.5% NaCl and arginine, and has a positive bile esculin hydrolysis test.", "gold_answer": "The organism responsible for causing intra-abdominal sepsis in this scenario is likely Enterococcus faecalis. Despite the resistance profile being reminiscent of Enterococcus faecium due to its frequent occurrence in hospital settings and high antibiotic resistance, Enterococcus faecalis is a more common cause of intra-abdominal infections and can exhibit similar resistance patterns, especially in nosocomial environments. The ability to grow in 6.5% NaCl, utilize arginine, and the positive bile esculin hydrolysis are consistent with Enterococcus spp., aligning with the characteristics of Enterococcus faecalis."}
{"question": "Based on the symptoms of jaundice for one month, initial flu-like presentation, pruritus, pale stools, abdominal findings of the liver enlarged 2 cm below the right costal margin without tenderness, unpalpable spleen, and the laboratory results showing elevated serum total bilirubin of 306 umol/L, ALT of 150 u/L, ALP of 890 u/L, and positive HBsAg, what is the most likely preliminary diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the presented symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely preliminary diagnosis is a flare of chronic hepatitis B with cholestatic features. The presence of jaundice, pruritus, and pale stools suggests impaired bile flow, while the significant elevation in serum bilirubin, ALT, and ALP levels is consistent with liver inflammation and cholestasis. The positive HBsAg indicates a hepatitis B infection, supporting the diagnosis. This scenario suggests that the patient may be a chronic carrier of hepatitis B experiencing a flare-up that disrupts normal liver and bile duct function."}
{"question": "A 20-year-old male patient collapses and dies suddenly while jogging. Autopsy reveals significant left ventricular hypertrophy predominantly affecting the septum with no valvular abnormalities. His family history notes an uncle who also died suddenly at age 20. Given these findings and suspecting an inherited condition, what histological or pathological finding is typically observed in such cases?", "gold_answer": "In the scenario described, the sudden death of the young man, combined with the autopsy findings and family history, very strongly suggests a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This is a genetic heart condition characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, particularly the septum, and is often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\nA key histological finding in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is myocardial disarray. This implies the heart muscle fibers are not aligned in the usual orderly manner but rather exhibit a chaotic, disorganized arrangement. This disarray, along with interstitial fibrosis, contributes to the risk of electrical instability in the heart, which can lead to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest, particularly during physical exertion.\n\nTherefore, given the case details, myocardial disarray would be the histological finding typically observed in this condition."}
{"question": "What is the pathogenesis of edema in a 6-year-old boy with minimal change disease, given that he presents with swelling around the eyes, lower extremity edema, and abdominal distension with hypoalbuminemia?", "gold_answer": "The pathogenesis of edema in a 6-year-old boy with minimal change disease is primarily due to massive proteinuria, which leads to significant hypoalbuminemia. In minimal change disease, there is damage to the glomeruli in the kidneys, which causes an excessive loss of albumin into the urine – a condition known as proteinuria. \n\nAlbumin, a crucial protein in the blood, helps maintain oncotic pressure, the pressure needed to keep fluid within the blood vessels. When albumin levels drop significantly due to the protein spillage, this pressure decreases, allowing fluid to escape from the blood vessels into the surrounding tissues, resulting in edema. This fluid leakage manifests as swelling around the eyes, in the lower extremities, and in the abdominal cavity (ascites), contributing to abdominal distension.\n\nIn summary, the edema seen in this child is a direct result of the reduced oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia secondary to the severe proteinuria characteristic of minimal change disease."}
{"question": "Which antiepileptic drug is associated with the development of hypertrichosis in children?", "gold_answer": "Phenytoin is the antiepileptic drug associated with the development of hypertrichosis in children. This medication is well-known for causing excessive hair growth as a side effect, along with other conditions like gingival hyperplasia. While other antiepileptic drugs have their own range of side effects, phenytoin is notably linked to hypertrichosis."}
{"question": "After a 15-month-old girl experienced a brief seizure characterized by rhythmic eye blinking and limb shaking, followed by a febrile state and no neurological abnormalities upon examination, what is the most appropriate next step in her management once she returns to an alert state and plays with toys?", "gold_answer": "The most appropriate next step in the management of this 15-month-old girl, who appears to have experienced a febrile seizure, is reassurance and guidance on managing her fever. Febrile seizures are common in young children and typically do not indicate a serious issue or require extensive investigation. Since she has returned to her normal, playful self, it's crucial to focus on educating the parents about what has happened. \n\nYou should reassure the parents that febrile seizures are generally harmless and let them know what to do if another seizure occurs. In addition, advise them on how to effectively manage her fever with medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen and ensure she stays well-hydrated. Encouraging them to monitor her temperature and providing information on when to seek further medical attention can also be valuable. This approach will help ease their anxieties and equip them to handle similar situations confidently in the future."}
{"question": "A 43-year-old man with epilepsy, controlled on phenytoin for 15 years, begins to experience occasional double vision, vertical nystagmus, and gait ataxia after another physician added a medication to his regimen. Considering these symptoms and the interaction with phenytoin, which medication is most likely to have been added?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms of double vision, vertical nystagmus, and gait ataxia in a patient taking phenytoin suggest phenytoin toxicity, likely due to increased phenytoin levels. Given the scenario, the addition of a new medication that interacts with phenytoin by inhibiting its metabolism is the probable culprit.\n\nCimetidine, a drug used for acid reflux or stomach ulcers, is known to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize phenytoin. This interaction can significantly increase phenytoin levels and lead to toxicity symptoms like those you described. Therefore, based on the known interactions and the symptoms presented, cimetidine is the most likely medication to have been added to this patient's regimen, causing the phenytoin toxicity."}
{"question": "Incision for drainage of parotid abscess is fashioned to avoid damage to which of the following structures?\nA. Facial nerve\nB. Parotid duct\nC. Retromandibular vein\nD. Carotid artery", "gold_answer": "The incision for the drainage of a parotid abscess is primarily fashioned to avoid damage to the facial nerve. The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) runs through the parotid gland and is responsible for controlling facial expressions. Damage to this nerve during a procedure can lead to facial paralysis, making it crucial to take precautions to avoid injuring it. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Facial nerve"}
{"question": "A 32-year-old male named Chandu presents with abdominal pain, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms, and visual hallucinations. Based on these symptoms, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms described—abdominal pain, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms, and visual hallucinations—the most likely diagnosis is acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by issues in the heme production pathway, leading to the accumulation of porphyrins or their precursors, which can cause the array of symptoms observed in Chandu. This condition can result in the combination of abdominal pain and neurological or psychiatric symptoms, including hallucinations, which aligns well with the clinical presentation provided."}
{"question": "A chronic alcoholic presents with repeated episodes of severe intractable abdominal pain. At evaluation the pancreatic duct was found to be dilated and stones were noted in the tail of pancreas. The most appropriate management is:\nA. Pancreatic Tail Resection\nB. Pancreatico Jejunostomy\nC. Percutaneous removal of stone\nD. Medical management", "gold_answer": "Based on the situation described, the most appropriate management for the chronic alcoholic with a dilated pancreatic duct and pancreatic stones located in the tail of the pancreas is option B: Pancreatico Jejunostomy. This surgical procedure, also known as a Puestow procedure, is particularly effective in cases of chronic pancreatitis where the main pancreatic duct is dilated. It involves creating a connection between the pancreatic duct and the jejunum, allowing for improved drainage and alleviating the associated pain. This targets the root cause of the symptoms by addressing the obstruction due to the stones and the ductal dilation."}
{"question": "In a 42-year-old HIV-positive patient with a history of non-compliance to antiretroviral therapy, who presents with an ulcerative oral cavity lesion characterized by a solid mass on CT that invades the mandible and exhibits plasmablastic differentiation upon biopsy, DNA of which virus is most likely to be identified in the tumor cells?", "gold_answer": "The DNA of the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is most likely to be identified in the tumor cells of a 42-year-old HIV-positive patient with the described conditions. Plasmablastic lymphoma, which is associated with EBV, often occurs in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with untreated or poorly managed HIV."}
{"question": "A 6-year-old boy presents with difficulty concentrating, social challenges, including frequent interruptions in conversations and excessive talking, inability to hop on one foot, and difficulty following three-step directions. He has specific craniofacial features such as a small head, wide-spaced eyes, short palpebral fissures, a thin and flat upper lip, a sunken nasal bridge, and a small jaw. Additionally, there is a 3/6 pansystolic murmur heard along the left lower sternal border. Considering these symptoms and physical findings, what is the most likely cause of these findings?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and physical findings you describe are highly suggestive of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). FAS is a condition that results from prenatal alcohol exposure, which can cause a range of developmental, cognitive, and structural deficits. The facial features like a small head, short palpebral fissures, a thin and flat upper lip, and a small jaw, alongside the heart murmur and developmental challenges, align closely with the characteristics of FAS. The difficulty in concentrating and social interaction issues further support this diagnosis. Overall, these findings strongly indicate that the child's condition is due to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome."}
{"question": "A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with fever and severe left knee pain, characterized by multiple painless pustular lesions on her ankles, the dorsum and soles of her feet, and a swollen, erythematous, and tender left knee. She is sexually active with inconsistent condom use. Arthrocentesis reveals yellow purulent fluid with a leukocyte count of 58,000/mm3, 93% neutrophils, but no crystals, and the Gram stain is negative. Based on these findings, what is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for her condition?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is a combination of **intravenous ceftriaxone** and **oral azithromycin**. This treatment targets a suspected disseminated gonococcal infection, which aligns with her symptoms of fever, joint pain, and skin pustules, along with her sexual history. Ceftriaxone effectively addresses the Neisseria gonorrhoeae, while azithromycin is included to treat potential co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis and to help curb antibiotic resistance."}
{"question": "A 59-year-old male with a history of bilateral knee arthritis has been experiencing epigastric pain that worsens with meals due to long-term aspirin use at high doses. What alternative medication could he have used instead of aspirin to minimize the risk of developing this type of gastrointestinal pain?", "gold_answer": "For a 59-year-old man experiencing gastrointestinal pain from long-term, high-dose aspirin use due to arthritis, switching to a selective COX-2 inhibitor like celecoxib could be beneficial. Celecoxib provides anti-inflammatory benefits similar to aspirin but with a reduced risk of gastrointestinal irritation, as it selectively inhibits the COX-2 enzyme involved in inflammation without significantly affecting the COX-1 enzyme that protects the stomach lining. This makes celecoxib a suitable alternative to minimize gastrointestinal pain while managing arthritis symptoms effectively."}
{"question": "A 50-year-old chronic smoker presents with hemoptysis, truncal obesity, and hypertension. Laboratory tests reveal elevated ACTH levels that are not suppressive with high-dose dexamethasone. Based on these clinical findings, what is the most probable diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical findings of a 50-year-old chronic smoker presenting with hemoptysis, truncal obesity, hypertension, elevated ACTH levels, and a lack of suppressibility with high-dose dexamethasone, the most probable diagnosis is ectopic ACTH syndrome. This condition is often associated with small cell lung carcinoma, especially in the context of a long-term smoker experiencing these symptoms. The combination of his smoking history, the respiratory symptom of hemoptysis, and the hormonal profile strongly points toward this type of lung cancer as the underlying cause of the ectopic ACTH production."}
{"question": "What clinical test should a dentist use to determine whether to start myofunctional appliance therapy for a 9-year-old patient with a retrognathic mandible and lip trap?", "gold_answer": "To determine whether to start myofunctional appliance therapy for a 9-year-old patient with a retrognathic mandible and lip trap, a dentist should begin with a cephalometric analysis. This clinical test provides detailed imagery of the skull and helps evaluate the relationship between the mandible and maxilla, assessing the degree of mandibular retrognathism. Additionally, the dentist should consider conducting a functional evaluation of the jaws' movement, bite, and oral habits, such as the lip trap. Evaluating the patient's growth potential through a bone age assessment (using hand or cervical vertebrae X-rays) is also crucial, as it helps determine the timing and potential impact of the therapy. Other assessments, like phonetic analysis, can further inform treatment decisions by examining speech patterns and tongue posture, which may affect or be affected by the jaw discrepancy. Combining these insights will aid in deciding on the appropriate timing for myofunctional therapy."}
{"question": "An unconscious 54-year-old female is admitted to the hospital. A CT scan reveals a tumor in her brain, producing a tentorial herniation. When she regains consciousness, her right eye is directed laterally and downward, with complete ptosis of her upper eyelid and pupillary dilation. Which of the following lobes of the brain is affected by the tumor?\nA. Parietal\nB. Temporal\nC. Occipital\nD. Frontal", "gold_answer": "The correct answer is B. Temporal.\n\nThe symptoms described – the eye being directed laterally and downward, complete ptosis, and pupillary dilation – suggest a dysfunction of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). In cases of brain herniation, particularly uncal herniation, the medial temporal lobe often presses against the brainstem and affects structures such as the oculomotor nerve. This results in the classic presentation of a \"blown\" pupil, ptosis, and the eye deviating downward and outward. Therefore, the temporal lobe is the one involved in this scenario due to the tentorial herniation."}
{"question": "List the pathogens that are classified as Category A bioterrorism agents.", "gold_answer": "Category A bioterrorism agents, as identified by the CDC, include pathogens that pose a significant risk to national security due to their ease of transmission and high mortality rates. These agents are:\n\n1. **Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis)** - Known for its spores that can be lethal when inhaled.\n2. **Botulism (Clostridium botulinum toxin)** - A potent toxin affecting the nervous system.\n3. **Plague (Yersinia pestis)** - Historically notorious and capable of rapid spread and severe outcomes if untreated.\n4. **Smallpox (Variola major)** - Although eradicated, its potential use in bioterrorism remains a concern due to its high mortality rate and contagiousness.\n5. **Tularemia (Francisella tularensis)** - Extremely infectious, even in small amounts.\n6. **Viral hemorrhagic fevers** - Including Ebola and Marburg viruses, known for severe symptoms and high mortality rates. Arenaviruses are also included in this category, causing similarly severe illnesses.\n\nThese agents require special preparedness due to their potential for widespread impact and the public health challenges they pose."}
{"question": "What is the angle of the inclined plane in Clarke's twin block functional appliance?", "gold_answer": "The angle of the inclined plane in Clarke's twin block functional appliance is typically around 70 degrees.

{"question": "A 61-year-old man presents with a history of fatigue and progressively worsening shortness of breath that is exacerbated when lying down. He recently started using two pillows at night to avoid waking up short of breath. Upon examination, a heart murmur is detected, and cardiac catheterization is performed. Based on these findings, describe the characteristics of the murmur that is most likely to be heard on cardiac auscultation for this patient's valvular condition.", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms of fatigue, orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying flat), and the use of multiple pillows at night, along with the presence of a heart murmur, the clinical picture suggests mitral regurgitation. In mitral regurgitation, incomplete closure of the mitral valve leads to backward flow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium during systole.\n\nThe characteristic murmur associated with mitral regurgitation is a holosystolic (or pansystolic) murmur. This murmur typically extends throughout the entirety of systole, starting with S1 (the first heart sound) and continuing up to S2 (the second heart sound). It is usually best heard at the apex of the heart – the point of maximal intensity – and often radiates to the left axilla due to the direction of regurgitant blood flow.\n\nTherefore, in this patient, cardiac auscultation is most likely to reveal a holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex, which may radiate to the left axilla."}
{"question": "What is the risk of spina bifida associated with the use of Phenytoin (Dilantin) in pregnant women with epilepsy?", "gold_answer": "Phenytoin (Dilantin) is associated with a risk of causing neural tube defects like spina bifida when used during pregnancy. While phenytoin is categorized as a teratogen and poses this risk, the likelihood of spina bifida due to phenytoin exposure is generally considered to be lower than with certain other antiepileptic drugs, such as valproic acid, which has a higher association with such defects. The risk with phenytoin is seen as moderate, and managing epilepsy in pregnant women involves balancing the risk of birth defects with the need to control seizures to ensure the health and safety of both the mother and the developing baby. This requires careful evaluation on a case-by-case basis, often with the guidance of healthcare professionals."}
{"question": "What is the next most useful investigation for a patient presenting with acute renal failure and a normal ultrasound abdomen report?", "gold_answer": "Given the information that the ultrasound shows no obstructions, eliminating post-renal causes, and considering the importance of distinguishing between pre-renal and intrinsic renal causes in acute renal failure, the next most useful investigation would be the calculation of the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). This test can help determine whether the renal failure is due to pre-renal causes, such as dehydration or reduced blood flow, or intrinsic renal causes, like acute tubular necrosis, based on how the kidneys are handling sodium."}
{"question": "What are two characteristics of G6PD deficiency regarding cellular morphology and sex preponderance?", "gold_answer": "G6PD deficiency is characterized by specific changes in red blood cell morphology and a particular sex preponderance. On a cellular level, the deficiency leads to the appearance of Heinz bodies, which are clumps of denatured hemoglobin within red blood cells. These cells are often also seen with 'bite cells,' which form as bits of the cell are removed by the spleen. Regarding sex preponderance, G6PD deficiency is more common in males because it is an X-linked recessive condition. Males, having only one X chromosome, are more likely to exhibit symptoms if they inherit the defective gene, whereas females would need two copies to be deficient."}
{"question": "An infant exhibits symptoms including irritability, increased muscle tone in the extremities, and recurrent seizures. Histological examination shows the presence of globoid cells around blood vessels in the brain tissue. What is the most probable diagnosis for this condition?", "gold_answer": "The most probable diagnosis for the condition described, given the infant's symptoms and the histological findings, is Krabbe disease. Krabbe disease, also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy, is characterized by the presence of globoid cells in the brain and is associated with neurological symptoms such as irritability, increased muscle tone, and seizures due to the destruction of myelin in the nervous system."}
{"question": "What is the safest test to perform on a patient with an acutely injured knee joint?", "gold_answer": "The safest test to perform on a patient with an acutely injured knee joint is a physical examination using specific maneuvers that can quickly and non-invasively provide insights into possible injuries. One such reliable and widely used test is the Lachmann test, which helps identify ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injuries. This test offers a safe, practical, and immediate assessment of the knee without the need for invasive procedures or imaging, making it an excellent initial approach in an acute injury setting."}
{"question": "A 7-year-old girl presents with recurrent epistaxis and easy bruising. Her lab results show a platelet count of 100,000/mm3, a prothrombin time of 12 seconds, a partial thromboplastin time of 33 seconds, and a bleeding time of 13 minutes. A peripheral blood smear reveals enlarged platelets, and a ristocetin assay shows no platelet aggregation. What is the most likely underlying cause of her condition?", "gold_answer": "The most likely underlying cause of the girl's condition is Bernard-Soulier syndrome. This is a genetic disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), the presence of enlarged platelets on a blood smear, prolonged bleeding time, and abnormal platelet function due to a defect in the glycoprotein Ib-IX complex on the surface of platelets. This defect specifically leads to the inability of platelets to aggregate in response to ristocetin, a key feature observed in testing. Bernard-Soulier syndrome explains the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings seen in this patient."}
{"question": "In a right-handed person, which condition is typically not associated with an injury to the left parietal lobe?", "gold_answer": "In a right-handed person, changes in personality are typically not associated with an injury to the left parietal lobe. This area of the brain is more involved with tasks related to language, mathematics, spatial reasoning, and coordination, rather than personality traits or mood, which are more closely linked to the frontal lobe."}
{"question": "A 44-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus presents with lethargy, disorientation, and a 2-week history of weakness, nausea, and vomiting. Her physical exam shows jugular venous distention and pitting edema. Laboratory findings reveal elevated potassium, chloride, urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels with decreased bicarbonate. Considering these findings, what is the most appropriate next step in her management?", "gold_answer": "The most appropriate next step in managing this patient is to initiate dialysis. The combination of her symptoms, physical exam findings, and laboratory results suggests she is experiencing acute renal failure with significant electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia, which poses a risk of severe cardiac complications. Additionally, the presence of fluid overload, indicated by jugular venous distention and pitting edema, supports the need for urgent intervention. Dialysis will help address the dangerous potassium levels, clear other toxins, and manage the fluid overload, providing immediate relief and stabilization of her condition."}
{"question": "A deceased individual is discovered with marks resembling the branching of a tree on the front of their chest. What is the most likely cause of these markings?", "gold_answer": "The most likely cause of the tree-like markings on the individual's chest is a lightning strike. These specific patterns, known as Lichtenberg figures, occur when a person is struck by lightning. The electricity spreads through the body, often leaving these unique, fern-like designs on the skin. Lichtenberg figures are a distinctive sign of lightning-related injuries and do not stem from other common conditions, diseases, or injuries."}
{"question": "During the autopsy of a 39-year-old female who succumbed to complications from systemic lupus erythematosus, medium-sized vegetations were discovered on both the mitral and tricuspid valves. What is the most likely explanation for the formation of these cardiac vegetations?", "gold_answer": "The medium-sized vegetations found on the mitral and tricuspid valves during the autopsy of a woman with systemic lupus erythematosus are most likely due to Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is a form of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis commonly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. It is characterized by the formation of sterile vegetations on cardiac valves, which occur due to immune complex deposition and inflammation rather than an infection. In this case, the vegetations align with the typical presentation associated with lupus, and there is no indication of an infectious process, making Libman-Sacks endocarditis the most probable cause."}
{"question": "In the context of methods involving tying legs or thighs with bamboo and pressing on the sides to cause pain, what is the specific term used to describe this technique?", "gold_answer": "The specific term used to describe the technique of tying legs or thighs with bamboo and pressing on them to cause pain is \"Chepuwa.\" This method involves using bamboo in a way that inflicts pain through binding and pressure, and it aligns with historical practices where bamboo's strength and flexibility were utilized in punishment or torture."}
{"question": "A 15-year-old girl presents with an 8-month history of fatigue, intermittent postprandial abdominal bloating and discomfort, foul-smelling, watery diarrhea, and a 7-kg (15-lb) weight loss. She also has a pruritic rash on her knees and laboratory tests reveal a hemoglobin concentration of 8.2 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume of 76 μm3. Further examination is most likely to show which specific serological finding associated with her conditions?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and laboratory findings you've described align well with celiac disease, particularly the presence of the pruritic rash on the knees, which is suggestive of dermatitis herpetiformis. In celiac disease, the most specific serological finding is the presence of anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies. These antibodies are highly sensitive and specific for celiac disease, and testing for them is a common step in diagnosing the condition. Given these considerations, further examination is most likely to show elevated levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies."}

{"question": "A 3-year-old male presents with his parents to a pediatrician for a new patient visit. The child was recently adopted and little is known about his prior medical or family history. The parents report that the child seems to be doing well, but they are concerned because the patient is much larger than any of the other 3-year-olds in his preschool class. They report that he eats a varied diet at home, and that they limit juice and snack foods. On physical exam, the patient is in the 73rd percentile for weight, 99th percentile for height, and 86th percentile for head circumference. He appears mildly developmentally delayed. He has a fair complexion and tall stature with a prominent sternum. The patient also has joint hypermobility and hyperelastic skin. He appears to have poor visual acuity and is referred to an ophthalmologist, who diagnoses downward lens subluxation of the right eye.\n\nThis child is most likely to develop which of the following complications?\nA. Aortic dissection\nB. Medullary thyroid cancer\nC. Osteoarthritis\nD. Thromboembolic stroke", "gold_answer": "Given the clinical presentation of the child, he is likely to have Homocystinuria. This is suggested by the combination of tall stature, joint hypermobility, developmental delay, fair complexion, and especially the downward lens subluxation. Homocystinuria results from a defect in the metabolism of the amino acid methionine, leading to elevated homocysteine levels. \n\nA key complication associated with Homocystinuria is an increased risk of thromboembolic events, due to the pro-thrombotic properties of elevated homocysteine. Therefore, among the options provided, the child is most likely to develop a thromboembolic stroke.\n\nThe correct answer is D. Thromboembolic stroke."}
{"question": "A 40-year-old patient with a 20-year history of consistent marijuana use presents with withdrawal symptoms.

{"question": "A 65-year-old male with normal renal function presents with focal seizures at a hospital. What is the drug of choice for treating his condition?", "gold_answer": "For a 65-year-old male with normal renal function experiencing focal seizures, carbamazepine is typically considered the drug of choice. Despite the potential for side effects and drug interactions, it remains a first-line option due to its proven efficacy in managing focal seizures. However, the decision might also weigh heavily on individual patient factors and preferences, so it's essential to consider these aspects during the treatment planning process."}
{"question": "In a case of acute exacerbation of asthma where salbutamol showed no improvement and intravenous corticosteroids were administered leading to improved condition, what is the mechanism by which corticosteroids exert their effect?", "gold_answer": "In cases of acute asthma exacerbation where salbutamol is insufficient, corticosteroids are used to address the underlying inflammation causing the symptoms. Corticosteroids work by reducing inflammation through several mechanisms:\n\n1. **Gene Expression Modulation**: Once inside the cells, corticosteroids bind to specific receptors and move to the cell's nucleus. Here, they regulate gene expression, increasing the production of anti-inflammatory proteins and decreasing the synthesis of pro-inflammatory signals. This action helps reduce the immune response that contributes to airway inflammation.\n\n2. **Rapid Anti-inflammatory Effects**: Beyond their genomic effects, corticosteroids can also exert rapid actions by influencing cell membrane processes and interacting with proteins or receptors outside the nucleus. This quick response is critical during acute episodes as it helps to stabilize and reduce inflammatory reactions swiftly.\n\n3. **Reduction of Mucosal Edema and Mucus Production**: By decreasing the activity of immune cells, corticosteroids help reduce the accumulation of mucus and edema in the airways, thereby improving airflow and breathing.\n\n4. **Vascular Stability**: Corticosteroids stabilize the blood vessel walls, leading to less leakage and reduced swelling in the airways. This results in decreased obstruction and smoother passage of air.\n\nThrough these mechanisms, corticosteroids effectively address the inflammation behind the asthma flare-up, providing significant relief and improvement in symptoms."}
{"question": "An investigator is examining the structural characteristics of pathogenic viruses using a scanning electron microscope. If a cell sample shows evidence of being infected by a virus with an envelope derived from nuclear membrane components, which medical condition is most likely to be associated with this infection?", "gold_answer": "The medical condition most likely associated with a virus that derives its envelope from nuclear membrane components is shingles. This condition is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which is part of the herpesvirus family known for budding from the inner nuclear membrane. The varicella-zoster virus primarily causes two major conditions: chickenpox, which occurs during initial infection, and shingles, which can occur later in life when the virus reactivates. The unique characteristic of herpetic viruses, including varicella-zoster, utilizing the nuclear membrane for their envelope formation points towards shingles as the associated medical condition in this context."}
{"question": "A 45-year-old homeless man presents to the emergency department unconscious, with a history of severe pain treated with hydromorphone and IV fluids on previous admissions. His lab results show hemoglobin 6 g/dL, hematocrit 20%, leukocyte count 6,500/mm^3, platelet count 197,000/mm^3, and reticulocyte count 0.4%. What condition is most commonly associated with these laboratory findings?", "gold_answer": "The laboratory findings, especially the severe anemia with a reticulocyte count of 0.4%, alongside normal leukocyte and platelet counts, suggest a condition affecting red blood cell production rather than increased destruction or loss. In this context, the patient's situation and lifestyle factors point towards a transient aplastic crisis caused by Parvovirus B19. This is particularly plausible given its propensity to temporarily halt erythropoiesis, especially in individuals with underlying risk factors or increased vulnerability, such as those with chronic conditions or in precarious living situations like homelessness."}
{"question": "According to Dardick's multicellular theory, which type of cell is not responsible for the origin of pleomorphic adenoma?", "gold_answer": "According to Dardick's multicellular theory, the excretory duct cells are not considered responsible for the origin of pleomorphic adenoma. This theory highlights the role of epithelial and myoepithelial cells, which have the potential to differentiate and contribute to the tumor's diverse cellular composition. Excretory duct cells, involved more in transporting secretions rather than differentiation, are not typically linked to the genesis of this type of tumor in the context of the multicellular theory."}
{"question": "Name a virus, other than HSV-1 and HSV-2, that causes cytopathologic findings characterized by multinucleated giant cells.", "gold_answer": "A virus other than HSV-1 and HSV-2 that causes cytopathologic findings characterized by multinucleated giant cells is the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV). VZV, responsible for chickenpox and shingles, is part of the herpesvirus family and can lead to similar cellular changes, including the formation of these giant cells."}
{"question": "An 18-month-old boy is examined during a routine check-up and is found to have a persistent holosystolic, harsh murmur, which was also noted at prior check-ups at 3 and 6 months. He was born with a 'hole in his heart,' but has not experienced cyanosis or heart failure, and is developmentally normal. What is the most likely anatomical cause of this murmur?", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided, the most likely anatomical cause of the persistent holosystolic murmur in this 18-month-old boy is a ventricular septal defect (VSD). This aligns with the history of being born with a \"hole in the heart\" and the absence of symptoms like cyanosis or heart failure. VSDs are common congenital heart defects where there's an opening in the ventricular septum, leading to the characteristic holosystolic murmur. Given the long-standing and stable nature of the murmur, a VSD fits this clinical picture well."}
{"question": "A 5-year-old boy presents with red eyes, dry, cracked lips, a rash on his hands and feet, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Considering these symptoms, what is the most important investigation to perform in order to rule out a serious cardiac complication associated with this condition?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms described, the child is likely presenting with Kawasaki disease, a condition that primarily affects young children and can lead to serious heart complications, particularly coronary artery aneurysms. To rule out these cardiac complications, the most important investigation to perform is an echocardiogram. This test will assess the heart and the coronary arteries for any abnormalities. It is a crucial step in managing Kawasaki disease, as early detection of coronary artery involvement can significantly impact treatment decisions and outcomes."}
{"question": "A 54-year-old man presents to the office for consultation regarding the results of recent laboratory studies. Medical history includes stage 3 chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension, which is currently well controlled with lisinopril and furosemide. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 17/min.

{"question": "What are the true characteristics of Bacillus anthracis with regard to its potential as a zoonotic disease, its role as an agent for bioterrorism, and any specific laboratory reactions it may exhibit?", "gold_answer": "Bacillus anthracis is indeed a bacterium with several significant characteristics regarding its impact on public health and safety. It is primarily known for causing anthrax, a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Livestock such as cattle, goats, and sheep are common hosts, and humans can be infected through direct contact with these animals or by handling their products, by inhalation of spores, or by consuming contaminated meat.\n\nBacillus anthracis is particularly concerning in terms of bioterrorism due to its ability to form robust, long-lived spores. These spores can survive extreme environmental conditions and can be disseminated through the air, making them a potent tool for bioterrorist activities. Inhalation of these spores is especially dangerous, leading to severe respiratory issues that can be fatal without urgent medical intervention.\n\nIn laboratory settings, Bacillus anthracis displays distinctive features that aid its identification. It is a large, rod-shaped, Gram-positive bacterium that forms unique 'medusa head' colonies when cultured on blood agar. It is non-motile and possesses a capsule composed of poly-D-glutamic acid, which is atypical as most bacterial capsules are polysaccharide-based. Additionally, its ability to form endospores is a hallmark feature, and these spores can be identified using a malachite green stain.\n\nOverall, Bacillus anthracis is a bacterium of significant concern due to its impact on animal and human health, its potential use in bioterrorism, and its distinctive laboratory characteristics."}

There is no associated blood in the stool. What is the most likely diagnosis for these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS frequently presents with abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, and the presence of mucus in the stool. A key hallmark of IBS is its tendency to worsen with stress, which aligns with the information given. The absence of blood in the stool and the stress-related exacerbation differentiate IBS from other gastrointestinal disorders like inflammatory bowel disease."}
{"question": "What is the upper limit of urinary mercury in a 7-month pregnant woman with several amalgam restorations and proximal caries detected, considering safety standards for mercury exposure during pregnancy?", "gold_answer": "Determining the upper limit of urinary mercury for a 7-month pregnant woman with several amalgam restorations is crucial due to the potential risks mercury poses to fetal development. The World Health Organization (WHO) provides a general guideline for urinary mercury levels, suggesting that they should not exceed 5 micrograms per gram of creatinine for the general population. This limit is used as a benchmark for avoiding adverse health effects, including those from dental amalgams.\n\nFor pregnant women, while there isn't a universally standardized lower threshold specifically stated for mercury exposure, the general advice tends to be more conservative. This is to account for the increased sensitivity of the developing fetus to mercury exposure. Consequently, while the upper limit remains 5 µg/g creatinine, it is advisable, based on precautionary principles, to aim for lower levels during pregnancy. Some experts might suggest striving for urinary mercury levels around or below 2 µg/g creatinine as a more cautious goal to further minimize potential risks.\n\nUltimately, prioritizing the lowest feasible mercury exposure is ideal. Pregnant women should discuss their individual circumstances with healthcare providers who can provide personalized advice based on the latest research and guidelines. Regular monitoring and professional guidance can aid in managing and maintaining safe exposure levels during pregnancy."}
{"question": "A 9-month-old girl presents with a 1-month history of poor feeding, irritability, hypotonia, muscle wasting, and hepatomegaly. Her laboratory tests reveal normal lactic acid levels, hypoglycemia with a serum glucose of 61 mg/dL, and elevated urine ketone bodies. Given these clinical features, which enzyme deficiency is most likely causing her symptoms?", "gold_answer": "Given the symptoms and laboratory findings in the 9-month-old girl, the clinical picture is suggestive of a type of Glycogen Storage Disease (GSD). The key symptoms—hypoglycemia, muscle wasting, hypotonia, hepatomegaly, normal lactic acid levels, and ketosis—point towards an issue with glycogen metabolism. \n\nIn this case, Glycogen Storage Disease type III, also known as Cori disease or Forbes disease, is a strong consideration. This condition results from a deficiency in the glycogen debranching enzyme. The deficiency in this enzyme impairs the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, resulting in the accumulation of limit dextrin in the liver and muscles, leading to hepatomegaly and muscle symptoms as observed.\n\nTherefore, the enzyme deficiency causing her symptoms is most likely the debranching enzyme, which is associated with Glycogen Storage Disease type III."}
{"question": "In a 14-year-old boy who has undergone kidney transplantation and is negative for past or present HIV, viral hepatitis, EBV, and CMV infection, and has an allergy to macrolides, what drug should be included in his immunosuppressive regimen to prevent transplant rejection?", "gold_answer": "In the case of a 14-year-old boy who has undergone a kidney transplant, includes core immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids like prednisone as part of the standard regimen to prevent rejection. Considering his age and to potentially minimize early nephrotoxicity from calcineurin inhibitors, adding basiliximab, an IL-2 receptor antagonist used for induction therapy, would be a prudent choice to include in his immunosuppressive strategy. This approach helps reduce the risk of acute rejection and spares the kidney from high doses of calcineurin inhibitors initially."}
{"question": "A 45-year-old female with progressive myopia develops sudden patchy vision loss in her right eye. During funduscopic examination, a large retinal detachment is noted in the right eye, while the left eye appears normal. What would likely be observed when testing the pupillary light reflex by shining a light in the right eye?", "gold_answer": "When testing the pupillary light reflex by shining a light in the right eye of a patient with a retinal detachment in the right eye, you would likely observe a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in that eye. This means that when the light is shone into the right eye, the pupil will not constrict (or will constrict less) compared to when the light is shone into the left eye. This is because the retinal detachment impairs the normal transmission of the light signal from the right eye, leading to a weaker pupillary reaction. As a result, the consensual response (the reaction of the left pupil) might also be diminished when the light is directed at the right eye. When the light is shone into the unaffected left eye, both pupils should constrict normally, indicating that the efferent pathways and the left eye's ability to sense light are intact."}
{"question": "What is the most appropriate management for a 26-year-old male presenting with a 4-day history of right-sided lower abdominal pain, frequent vomiting, and a clinically tender lump in the right iliac fossa?", "gold_answer": "The most appropriate management for a 26-year-old male presenting with a 4-day history of right-sided lower abdominal pain, frequent vomiting, and a clinically tender lump in the right iliac fossa is conservative management. This approach typically involves the use of antibiotics to address the infection and possibly percutaneous drainage if an abscess is present. The strategy, known as the Ochsner-Sherren regimen, is aimed at allowing the inflammation to subside before considering any surgical intervention, such as an appendectomy. This method is preferred in cases where an appendiceal mass or abscess is formed, as immediate surgery could exacerbate the condition due to the inflamed and friable tissues."}
{"question": "An 8-year-old girl presents with decreased oral intake, body aches, lymphadenopathy, and a history of playing with neighborhood cats and dogs for 5 days. She exhibits a low-grade fever, and examination reveals a tender lymph node in the right posterior cervical area with a nearly healed scratch in the right occipital region. Considering her symptoms and exposure history, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and history provided strongly suggest that the most likely diagnosis for the 8-year-old girl is cat scratch disease. This condition is caused by the bacterium Bartonella henselae, which is commonly transmitted to humans via scratches or bites from infected cats. The girl's symptoms, including decreased oral intake, body aches, tender lymphadenopathy specifically in the area where a scratch is located, and low-grade fever, align closely with those typically seen in cat scratch disease. Her recent interaction with neighborhood cats further supports this diagnosis."}
{"question": "What is one factor that is not an explanation for decreased variability of the fetal heart tracing?", "gold_answer": "One factor that is not an explanation for decreased variability of the fetal heart tracing is fetal stimulation. In fact, fetal stimulation is generally used to increase or assess the reactivity of fetal heart rate, often resulting in increased variability rather than decreased."}
{"question": "A patient with hoarseness of voice was found to be having pachydermia laryngis. All of the following are true except:\nA. It is a hyperkeratotic lesion present within the anterior two-third of the vocal cords\nB. It is not premalignant lesion\nC. Diagnosis is made by biopsy\nD. On microscopy it shows acanthosis and hyperkeratosis", "gold_answer": "The statement that is not true about pachydermia laryngis is:\n\nA. It is a hyperkeratotic lesion present within the anterior two-third of the vocal cords.\n\nPachydermia laryngis typically affects the interarytenoid area or the posterior third of the vocal cords, not the anterior two-thirds. All other options accurately describe aspects of pachydermia laryngis."}
{"question": "A 10-year-old boy who suffered from head trauma and has been unconscious for 2 weeks is intubated. He develops a fever of 38.7°C (103°F) and has worsening oxygenation. A chest X-ray shows a pleural effusion and multiple abscesses in the lung parenchyma. What microorganism is most likely responsible for this type of pulmonary infection under these clinical circumstances?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical scenario presented, the microorganism most likely responsible for the pulmonary infection in this 10-year-old boy is Staphylococcus aureus. The prolonged intubation and the findings of a pleural effusion along with multiple lung abscesses strongly suggest an infection with this bacterium, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is known to cause severe lung infections, including abscess formation, in hospital settings."}
{"question": "Which antimicrobial is not considered a type I calcimimetic that mimics the stimulatory effect of calcium on the calcium-sensing receptor to inhibit PTH secretion by the parathyroid gland?", "gold_answer": "Antimicrobials are not designed to interact with the calcium-sensing receptors or mimic the effects of calcium like calcimimetics do. Instead, they target and eliminate microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Therefore, no antimicrobial is considered a type I calcimimetic."}
{"question": "A 36-year-old woman presents with a skin rash characterized by swelling of the face and raised, erythematous plaques after taking an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection. What physiological mechanism is most likely responsible for these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms described—facial swelling and raised, red plaques that appeared after taking an antibiotic—are indicative of a Type I hypersensitivity reaction. This type of allergic reaction is mediated by the immune system's production of IgE antibodies in response to the allergen, which, in this case, is the antibiotic.\n\nWhen the woman was exposed to the antibiotic, these IgE antibodies bound to the surface of mast cells and basophils, leading to cross-linking. This event triggers the degranulation of these cells and the subsequent release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine plays a crucial role here by causing vasodilation and increasing the permeability of blood vessels, leading to the swelling and redness associated with the rash.\n\nTherefore, the physiological mechanism responsible for her symptoms is the release of histamine and other mediators following IgE-mediated degranulation of mast cells and basophils—a typical characteristic of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction."}
{"question": "A factory worker exhibits symptoms of excessive salivation, blue lines on gums, tremors, disturbed personality, insomnia, and loss of appetite. What type of poisoning is most likely the cause of these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms described, particularly the blue lines on the gums, tremors, disturbed personality, and excessive salivation, suggest a case of poisoning. While the blue lines on the gums, often referred to as 'lead lines' or Burton’s line, can typically indicate lead poisoning, the combination of excessive salivation, tremors, and other neurological symptoms you mention align more closely with mercury poisoning. \n\nIn industrial settings, workers sometimes encounter mercury, which can lead to these specific symptoms including neurological disturbances. Thus, given the symptom profile provided and the industrial context, mercury poisoning is the most likely cause of these symptoms."}
{"question": "A 52-year-old man presents with right shoulder pain after repainting his house, with physical examination showing right subacromial tenderness. The pain is elicited by having the patient abduct his shoulder against resistance with his arm flexed forward at 30° and his thumb pointing downwards. Which muscle's tendon is most likely injured based on these findings?", "gold_answer": "Based on the examination findings you've described, it is most likely that the supraspinatus muscle's tendon is injured. The scenario you described, particularly the pain elicited during the 'Empty Can' test (where the shoulder is abducted against resistance with the arm flexed forward at 30° and the thumb pointing downwards), strongly suggests involvement of the supraspinatus. Furthermore, the subacromial tenderness aligns with this, as the supraspinatus tendon runs through the subacromial space, making it susceptible to injury in activities involving overhead motions."}

{"question": "An 11-year-old boy, previously healthy, developed worsening thumb pain after being bitten by a cat two weeks ago. The bite wound became red, warm, and swollen, with fever up to 103.6°F. Radiographs show osteomyelitis at the proximal phalanx. What is the most likely bacterial cause of this osteomyelitis in the context of a cat bite?", "gold_answer": "Given the scenario, the most likely bacterial cause of the osteomyelitis in this 11-year-old boy, following a cat bite, is Pasteurella multocida. This bacterium is commonly found in the mouths of cats and is known for causing infections in humans, particularly after bites. The symptoms described, including the redness, warmth, swelling, and high fever, as well as the development of osteomyelitis, are consistent with an infection by Pasteurella multocida. Prompt medical treatment is crucial to manage such infections effectively."}
{"question": "A 67-year-old man presents with fatigue, progressive abdominal distention, and yellow skin coloration for the past 2 weeks. He denies fever and other symptoms, and his past medical history is unremarkable. However, he reports a heavy history of alcohol consumption which he recently quit. On examination, he is jaundiced, appears ill, and demonstrates shifting dullness and a positive fluid wave in the abdomen, icteric sclera, and bilateral gynecomastia. His lab results show platelets at 86,000/mm3, AST 108 U/L, ALT 55 U/L, and GGT 185 U/L. Based on these findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms and laboratory findings presented in this 67-year-old man strongly suggest alcoholic cirrhosis as the most likely diagnosis. The key indications include his history of heavy alcohol use, the presence of jaundice (yellow skin and icteric sclera), ascites (indicated by shifting dullness and a positive fluid wave), and gynecomastia.\n\nAdditionally, laboratory findings support liver impairment: \n- Elevated AST and ALT levels, with AST greater than ALT, align with alcoholic liver disease.\n- Elevated GGT, commonly associated with alcohol consumption and liver dysfunction.\n- Low platelet count, which can occur due to portal hypertension associated with cirrhosis.\n\nThese factors converge to paint a clinical picture classic for alcoholic cirrhosis, especially considering his recent cessation of alcohol, which often occurs secondary to liver decompensation symptoms."}

{"question": "A 45-year-old female patient presents with abdominal discomfort. On pelvic examination, there is enlargement of the uterus with the absence of nodularity. A biopsy reveals the extension of endometrial glands to the myometrium. What is the most accurate diagnosis based on these findings?", "gold_answer": "Based on the information provided, the most accurate diagnosis for the 45-year-old female patient is adenomyosis. This condition is characterized by the presence of endometrial glands within the myometrium, leading to a diffusely enlarged uterus without the nodularity often associated with fibroids. The clinical findings and biopsy results align well with adenomyosis, making it the likely diagnosis."}
{"question": "What is responsible for the increase in cytosolic calcium from intracellular storage during smooth muscle contraction?", "gold_answer": "The increase in cytosolic calcium from intracellular storage during smooth muscle contraction is primarily mediated by inositol trisphosphate (IP3). When extracellular signals, such as hormones or neurotransmitters, bind to G protein-coupled receptors on the smooth muscle cell, it activates an enzyme called phospholipase C. This enzyme converts the membrane phospholipid PIP2 into IP3 and DAG. IP3 then diffuses through the cytosol and binds to IP3 receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which prompts these receptors to release calcium stored within the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. This process is crucial for initiating smooth muscle contraction. Additionally, ryanodine receptors (RyRs) may also contribute to this release through a mechanism known as calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), further increasing cytosolic calcium levels."}
{"question": "What are the recommended treatment options for a 35-year-old woman diagnosed with CIN grade III on colposcopic biopsy?", "gold_answer": "For a 35-year-old woman diagnosed with CIN III (Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade III), the recommended treatment options are excisional procedures, which are effective and allow for histological examination of the removed tissue. The two common excisional procedures are:\n\n1. **LEEP (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure):** This method uses a loop-shaped wire charged with an electric current to excise abnormal tissue. It's widely used due to its effectiveness and relatively low risk, though it can slightly increase the risk of preterm birth in future pregnancies.\n\n2. **Cold Knife Conization:** This procedure involves the surgical removal of a cone-shaped piece of the cervix containing the abnormal cells using a scalpel. It also allows the pathologist to examine the margins of the excised tissue to ensure complete removal of dysplastic cells.\n\nBoth procedures are well-suited to treat CIN III, as they allow healthcare providers to ensure that all abnormal tissue has been effectively removed, reducing the risk of progression to cervical cancer. Detailed discussion with the healthcare provider can help determine the best approach, taking into consideration personal health factors and future family planning desires."}
{"question": "Based on the history and physical examination of a 24-year-old female with irregular menses, generalized hair growth, and acne, what condition should be excluded from the differential diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the presented symptoms of irregular periods, excess hair growth, and acne, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common conditions to consider due to its strong association with these symptoms. Conditions like congenital adrenal hyperplasia and androgen-secreting tumors should also be considered due to their potential to mimic these symptoms.\n\nHowever, hyperprolactinemia is less likely to be directly responsible for the combination of increased hair growth and acne, as it primarily affects menstrual regularity through elevated prolactin levels. Typically, hyperprolactinemia would cause menstrual irregularities but might not directly explain the presence of hirsutism and acne unless there is an associated androgen issue, which is not common. Therefore, in this context, hyperprolactinemia should be excluded from the differential diagnosis when focusing specifically on the immediate causes of acne and increased hair growth."}
{"question": "What is the recommended management of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, such as losartan, for a hypertensive patient scheduled for hernia repair surgery?", "gold_answer": "For a hypertensive patient scheduled for hernia repair surgery who is taking an angiotensin II receptor antagonist like losartan, the general recommendation is to withhold the medication on the day of the surgery. This approach is typically suggested to mitigate the risk of intraoperative hypotension, which can occur if the medication is continued up until the time of surgery.\n\nStopping the medication about 24 hours before the procedure is often advised in practice, although this can vary based on individual patient risk factors and the specific circumstances of the surgery. It's important to collaborate with the anesthesiologist and surgical team to customize the plan according to the patient's overall health, blood pressure control, and any other cardiovascular considerations.\n\nUltimately, while guidelines provide general advice, personalized care is essential. The decision to stop or continue ARBs should be tailored to the patient’s needs, with the goal of minimizing surgical risk while maintaining adequate blood pressure control."}
{"question": "A 72-year-old man presents with vision changes, a droopy right eyelid, persistent constriction of his right pupil, and cracked, dry skin on the right side of his face. Considering these symptoms, what condition is most likely responsible for this presentation?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms you describe—a droopy right eyelid (ptosis), a constricted right pupil (miosis), and dry, cracked skin on one side of the face (anhidrosis)—are characteristic of Horner's syndrome. Horner's syndrome occurs when there is an interruption in the sympathetic pathways that affect the eye and facial area.\n\nIn this case, given the age of the patient and the combination of these symptoms, one likely underlying cause could be a Pancoast tumor. Pancoast tumors are lung cancers that occur at the top of the lung and can compress the sympathetic nerves, leading to Horner's syndrome. It's important for this individual to undergo further diagnostic evaluations, such as imaging studies, to confirm the presence of a Pancoast tumor or to identify any other potential cause for the Horner’s syndrome."}
{"question": "A 65-year-old woman with a history of heavy smoking presents with a new-onset seizure while having a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and recent unexplained weight loss. Considering these factors and the absence of protective measures against sun exposure, what is the most likely underlying diagnosis causing her symptoms?", "gold_answer": "Given the information provided, the most likely underlying diagnosis causing the woman's symptoms is a metastatic brain lesion from primary lung cancer. Her history of heavy smoking raises a significant risk for lung cancer, which is known for frequent metastasis to the brain, potentially leading to seizures. The unexplained weight loss further supports the suspicion of an underlying malignancy, often observed in cancer patients. While her chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes are crucial to manage, they are not typical causes of new-onset seizures. Overall, her clinical presentation aligns most consistently with lung cancer that has metastasized to the brain."}

Pneumocystis jiroveci", "gold_answer": "The most probable diagnosis for a person with a CD4 count of 200 who presents with difficulty breathing is D. Pneumocystis jiroveci. At this CD4 level, the immune system is significantly compromised, making the individual highly susceptible to opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), which is well-known for causing respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath in advanced HIV/AIDS cases."}
{"question": "Oximes are mainstay of treatment in toxicology. All of the following poisonings are indications for using oximes, EXCEPT:\nA. Tik20\nB. Baygon\nC. Malathion\nD. Parathion", "gold_answer": "Oximes are used in the treatment of organophosphate poisoning because they help reactivate acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme inhibited by these substances. Malathion, Parathion, and Tik20 are all organophosphate insecticides, and oximes are indicated for their poisoning. On the other hand, Baygon, which is associated with the carbamate class (specifically propoxur), does not typically involve treatment with oximes. Oximes are generally not recommended for carbamate poisoning due to the potential for worsening the condition. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**B. Baygon**"}
{"question": "In the scenario where a 17-year-old presents with signs of depression and admits to self-harm and having a plan to commit suicide, what is the most appropriate immediate course of action for a healthcare provider to take to ensure the patient's safety?", "gold_answer": "In this scenario, the most appropriate immediate course of action for a healthcare provider is to arrange for the 17-year-old to be admitted to a hospital for inpatient care. Given the seriousness of their condition, including active self-harm and having a specific plan for suicide, the individual is at high risk of harm. Hospitalization provides the necessary environment for close supervision and immediate intervention by mental health professionals. This step is crucial to ensure the patient's safety, facilitate a thorough psychiatric assessment, and begin appropriate treatment. Additionally, while the involvement of guardians in decision-making is important, the immediate priority in such high-risk situations is the safety of the patient, which may require urgent action without delay."}
{"question": "In the basic model of a nuclear family life cycle, what is the phase called that starts with the birth of the last child and ends when the first child leaves home?", "gold_answer": "In the basic model of a nuclear family life cycle, the phase you're referring to is often called the \"Family with School-Age Children\" or sometimes encapsulated within the \"Family with Young Children\" stage. This period typically spans from the birth of the youngest child up until the point the first child leaves home to begin independent living. It's a dynamic and engaging period where the family's focus is heavily on child-rearing across various ages, preparing them for their eventual adult lives."}
{"question": "A 26-year-old man with HIV presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, and lab results indicating a low CD4+ count and elevated LDH. His chest radiography shows bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates. Given his presentation and inability to afford HAART medication, which stain should be used on a sputum sample to visualize the most likely organism causing his condition?", "gold_answer": "Based on the clinical presentation of the patient—his symptoms, low CD4+ count, elevated LDH levels, and the characteristic bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates observed in the chest X-ray—it is highly suggestive that the patient is suffering from Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This is a common opportunistic infection in individuals with HIV, particularly those who are not on antiretroviral therapy and have a severely compromised immune system.\n\nTo confirm the presence of Pneumocystis jirovecii, the Methenamine silver stain (also known as Gomori methenamine silver stain) should be used on the sputum sample. This staining technique is specifically effective for visualizing the cyst walls of Pneumocystis jirovecii, thus aiding in the diagnosis of PJP."}

{"question": "What disease process is most likely responsible for the pulmonary symptoms and findings in a 45-year-old man with progressive dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, prominent pulmonary component of S2, tricuspid insufficiency, jugular venous distension, antiphospholipid antibodies, eccentric occlusions in pulmonary arteries, and mosaic attenuation on CT angiography?", "gold_answer": "The collection of symptoms and findings in this scenario is most consistent with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The 45-year-old man's progressive dyspnea on exertion and fatigue are classic symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. The prominent pulmonary component of S2, tricuspid insufficiency, and jugular venous distension suggest right heart strain due to elevated pressures in the pulmonary circulation.\n\nThe presence of antiphospholipid antibodies is a significant clue. These antibodies are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, including recurrent pulmonary emboli that don't fully resolve, leading to CTEPH. This condition results from organized blood clots that become incorporated into the pulmonary arterial wall, causing persistent obstruction and elevated pulmonary artery pressure.\n\nThe CT angiography findings of eccentric occlusions in the pulmonary arteries and mosaic attenuation further support this diagnosis. Mosaic attenuation indicates regions of varying perfusion, typical in CTEPH due to mismatched blood flow caused by chronic thromboembolic obstructions.\n\nGiven all these pieces of evidence, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is the most likely disease process responsible for the pulmonary symptoms and findings in this patient, particularly in the context of antiphospholipid syndrome."}
{"question": "A 79-year-old man, after elective surgery and subsequent confusion and agitation, was administered a drug affecting the opening frequency of a neuronal ion channel, leading to symptoms such as weakness, tremors, uncoordinated muscle movements, blurred vision, and disorientation. What specific medication could be used to reverse the effects of the drug administered to this patient?", "gold_answer": "To reverse the effects of a benzodiazepine, which increases the frequency of neuronal ion channel opening and could be causing the patient's symptoms, the appropriate medication would be Flumazenil. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist that can effectively counteract the central nervous system effects of benzodiazepines, such as those causing the patient's weakness, tremors, and disorientation."}
{"question": "A 5-day-old newborn is brought into the pediatrician by her parents for new-onset vaginal bleeding. This morning, when the patient’s father was changing her diaper he noticed blood and white vaginal discharge. The patient was born at 39 weeks to a G1P1 mother who has well-controlled type 1 diabetes. The pregnancy and the vaginal delivery were unremarkable. Apgar scores were 8/9. The mother is breast-feeding and reports that the patient is feeding well. The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 70/48 mmHg, pulse is 134/min, and respirations are 38/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

{"question": "What is the likely diagnosis for an individual presenting with normal serum alkaline phosphatase, normal PTH, normal Vitamin D3, and elevated serum calcium levels?", "gold_answer": "The likely diagnosis for an individual presenting with normal serum alkaline phosphatase, normal PTH, normal Vitamin D3, and elevated serum calcium levels is hypercalcemia of malignancy. This condition is often due to the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) by certain cancers, which can elevate calcium levels without altering standard parathyroid hormone or vitamin D levels."}
{"question": "A 28-year-old woman with a history of intravenous drug use presents with symptoms including fatigue, jaundice, confusion, and blood in her stools. She shows right upper quadrant pain and tests reveal virions in her blood with a partially double-stranded DNA genome and a single-stranded RNA genome, sharing the same lipoprotein envelope. Which pathogen is she most likely infected with?", "gold_answer": "The patient is most likely co-infected with both hepatitis B and hepatitis D viruses. The presence of virions with a partially double-stranded DNA genome points to the hepatitis B virus, known for that characteristic structure. Meanwhile, the identification of a single-stranded RNA genome suggests hepatitis D virus, which relies on hepatitis B for its envelope, making co-infection necessary. This explanation fits well with the patient's symptoms, history of intravenous drug use, and the unique viral structures noted in the tests."}
{"question": "A 55-year-old man had an ECG taken during his annual physical. The ECG results show a net deflection of -1.2 millivolts in standard limb lead I and a net deflection of +1.2 millivolts in standard limb lead II. What is the mean electrical axis of his QRS complex based on these readings?", "gold_answer": "The mean electrical axis of the QRS complex based on the given ECG readings is approximately +120 degrees. This conclusion comes from the analysis of the deflection readings: a negative net deflection in lead I (-1.2 mV) suggests that the electrical activity is moving away from the direction of lead I, whereas a positive net deflection in lead II (+1.2 mV) indicates that the electrical activity is moving towards the direction of lead II, which is at +60 degrees. The combination of these deflections suggests that the electrical axis is shifted further right, approximately toward +120 degrees."}
{"question": "According to the Ellis and Dewey classification, what is the classification number for the displacement of a tooth without fracture of the crown or root?", "gold_answer": "In the Ellis and Dewey classification for tooth injuries, a displacement of a tooth without a fracture of the crown or root is categorized as Class 5. This classification typically focuses specifically on the position change of a tooth due to luxation injuries, such as intrusion, extrusion, or lateral luxation, while the structural integrity of the tooth remains intact."}
{"question": "Describe the combination of symptoms that are characteristic of Job syndrome (Hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome) in a 10-year-old boy from Sri Lanka, specifically highlighting the roles of eosinophilia, recurrent infections, and skin conditions.", "gold_answer": "Job syndrome, or Hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome, in a 10-year-old boy from Sri Lanka, presents a specific combination of symptoms linked to immune system dysfunction, characterized by extremely high levels of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) and eosinophilia. \n\nThe condition prominently features recurrent infections, primarily targeting the skin and lungs. The child may suffer from repeated bacterial skin infections, often due to Staphylococcus aureus, leading to abscesses and boils. These skin conditions are compounded by chronic eczema, exacerbated by allergic responses driven by elevated eosinophil counts, which lead to persistent itching and inflammations. \n\nPulmonary issues are also a hallmark, with the boy likely experiencing repeated bouts of pneumonia. This not only poses a challenge due to frequent lung infections but can also result in the formation of pneumatoceles, or air-filled cysts within the lungs. \n\nBeyond these recurrent infections and skin conditions, children with Job syndrome might have distinctive facial features and retain their primary teeth longer than usual. The underlying issue is often related to dysfunctional neutrophil activity, which hampers the immune system's ability to respond adequately to infections. This combination of symptoms, alongside striking laboratory findings of high IgE and eosinophilia, strongly indicates Job syndrome."}

Hand hygiene is a cornerstone of infection control and is vital in preventing the transmission of infectious agents in healthcare settings. Ensure that all staff are consistently performing proper hand washing or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers according to established guidelines from health authorities like the CDC and WHO. Additionally, a refresher training for staff on the importance of hand hygiene and proper techniques can reinforce this critical practice. This immediate and practical step will help break the chain of infection transmission and protect patient safety."}
{"question": "What neurotransmitter is normally released in the SA node of the heart in response to increased blood pressure?", "gold_answer": "The neurotransmitter that is released in the sinoatrial (SA) node of the heart in response to increased blood pressure is acetylcholine. This release is part of the parasympathetic nervous system's response to help lower the heart rate and bring blood pressure back to normal levels. Acetylcholine works by interacting with muscarinic receptors, leading to a decrease in heart rate."}
{"question": "A 78-year-old man is experiencing confusion, blurred vision, and gingival bleeding, along with a history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. He has cervical lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, with a normal skeletal survey and an abnormal serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation but normal urine electrophoresis. Based on these clinical findings and laboratory results, what is the most likely diagnosis that explains these symptoms?", "gold_answer": "Based on the provided symptoms and clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis for this 78-year-old man is Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. This condition is characterized by the presence of an IgM monoclonal protein, which can lead to symptoms of hyperviscosity such as confusion, blurred vision, and bleeding tendencies. The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and a normal skeletal survey supports this diagnosis, as bone lesions are typically absent in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, unlike in multiple myeloma. Furthermore, the history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) can, in some cases, progress to Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, making it a plausible conclusion given the presented indicators."}
{"question": "Based on the 2015 criteria from the American Heart Association and the World Heart Federation, what is the incidence rate per 100,000 school-aged children per year that defines a low risk of Acute Rheumatic Fever?", "gold_answer": "According to the 2015 guidelines from the American Heart Association and the World Heart Federation, a population is considered to have a low risk of Acute Rheumatic Fever if the incidence rate is less than 2 cases per 100,000 school-aged children per year."}
{"question": "A patient who is obese, diabetic, has hypertension, and is a smoker, is on anti-hypertensive and oral hypoglycemic agents, and complains of apnea during the night. Polysomnography shows five apneic episodes and one hypopneic episode per hour. Considering these findings, what is the most effective initial management strategy you would recommend for this patient?", "gold_answer": "For this patient, who has mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) alongside obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking habits, the most effective initial management strategy would be to focus on lifestyle changes aimed at weight loss and smoking cessation. These interventions can significantly improve their OSA symptoms and overall health.\n\nWeight loss is particularly important as it can reduce the severity of OSA, by decreasing the amount of fat around the neck and airway, thereby reducing the frequency of apneic events. Even a modest amount of weight loss can lead to significant improvements in sleep apnea symptoms and also provide benefits for diabetes and hypertension management.\n\nSmoking cessation is crucial because smoking can increase inflammation and airway resistance, exacerbating sleep apnea symptoms. Quitting smoking also reduces cardiovascular risks, which is vital for someone with hypertension and diabetes.\n\nEncouraging these lifestyle changes addresses multiple aspects of the patient’s health and targets the root causes of their OSA, making it an effective and holistic approach. While other treatments like CPAP therapy or oral appliances might be required later if symptoms persist or worsen, starting with these lifestyle modifications is a prudent and impactful first step."}

Intravenous Mannitol", "gold_answer": "For a patient showing symptoms suggestive of an ischemic stroke, such as sudden onset right-sided weakness and expressive dysphasia, prompt intervention is crucial. The absence of contraindications like intracranial hemorrhage—often assessed via a non-contrast CT scan—facilitates the use of thrombolytic therapy. Given that we potentially have an ischemic stroke and assuming the time window for treatment is met, intravenous Reteplase (a thrombolytic agent) is an appropriate choice to restore blood flow to the brain. Thus, option C, \"Intravenous Reteplase,\" is the best step in the management of this patient."}
{"question": "What bacterial infection is most likely responsible for causing a hyperemic edema of the larynx and epiglottis that rapidly leads to respiratory obstruction in young children?", "gold_answer": "Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is the bacterial infection most commonly associated with causing hyperemic edema of the larynx and epiglottis, leading to rapid respiratory obstruction in young children. This condition, known as epiglottitis, was particularly feared before the introduction of the Hib vaccine, as it could progress quickly and require urgent medical intervention. Although less common now due to widespread vaccination, Hib remains a textbook cause of these symptoms in affected children."}

{"question": "What is the mechanism of action of the medication used to treat hepatic encephalopathy in a patient demonstrating mental status changes and asterixis?", "gold_answer": "The medication commonly used to treat hepatic encephalopathy, particularly in patients with symptoms such as mental status changes and asterixis, is lactulose. Lactulose is a non-absorbable disaccharide that exerts its effect primarily in the colon. There, colonic bacteria ferment lactulose into organic acids like lactic and acetic acid, which reduces the pH of the colon. This acidic environment converts ammonia (NH3) into its ionized form, ammonium (NH4+), which is less absorbable and less likely to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream. Additionally, lactulose acts as a laxative, increasing bowel movement frequency and expediting the removal of ammonia from the gastrointestinal tract. Together, these actions help lower the systemic ammonia levels, thereby alleviating the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy."}
{"question": "What neurotransmitter is usually associated with increased levels in the brain following the ingestion of l-tryptophan?", "gold_answer": "The neurotransmitter most commonly associated with increased levels in the brain following the ingestion of L-tryptophan is **serotonin**. \n\nL-tryptophan is metabolized in the body through a specific pathway where it is first converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase. 5-HTP is then further converted into serotonin by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Serotonin plays a key role in regulating mood, sleep, and appetite, among other functions. \n\nHowever, for L-tryptophan to influence brain serotonin levels, it must cross the blood-brain barrier. This process is competitive because L-tryptophan shares transport systems with other amino acids. Additionally, factors such as the availability of cofactors like vitamin B6 and the efficiency of enzymatic pathways can impact the extent of serotonin production.\n\nIn summary, the primary neurotransmitter linked to L-tryptophan metabolism in the brain is serotonin."}

Warfarin", "gold_answer": "Given Shaswat's symptoms and his medical history, it's likely that he is experiencing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), especially given the drop in his platelet count after receiving unfractionated heparin. HIT is a serious condition where using more heparin or administering platelet infusions can worsen the situation by increasing the risk of thrombosis.\n\nIn managing HIT, the primary step is to discontinue heparin and switch to a different anticoagulant that doesn't trigger this immune-mediated response. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor, making it a suitable choice for treating HIT. It's effective in preventing further clot formation without relying on heparin.\n\nTherefore, the best option for treating Shaswat's condition is:\n\nC. Argatroban"}
{"question": "What is the most likely cause of the pain experienced by the 42-year-old patient diagnosed with plantar fasciitis, particularly considering the physical examination and X-ray findings?", "gold_answer": "The most likely cause of the pain experienced by the 42-year-old patient with plantar fasciitis is the inflammation and microtears in the plantar fascia, rather than the calcaneal spur seen on the X-ray. While the X-ray finding of a calcaneal spur might seem noteworthy, these spurs are generally not the source of the pain. Instead, the discomfort is more commonly attributed to the condition of the plantar fascia itself, as it becomes strained and inflamed. This aligns with the physical examination that typically reveals tenderness in the heel area, particularly near the inside of the calcaneus. Therefore, addressing the inflammation and stress on the plantar fascia should be the focus of managing the pain."}

{"question": "In a patient with left-sided colon carcinoma presenting with obstruction, what is the most appropriate surgical treatment to address the obstruction?", "gold_answer": "In the case of a patient with left-sided colon carcinoma presenting with obstruction, the most appropriate surgical treatment often depends on the specific clinical circumstances, including the patient's overall stability, signs of infection or peritonitis, and the surgeon's evaluation of risks. \n\nIf the patient is stable and there's no indication of severe infection or compromised tissue viability, a resection with primary anastomosis can be a preferred approach. This option attempts to remove the obstructive tumor while restoring bowel continuity in a single surgery. However, this requires careful assessment of the surgical site to ensure adequate blood supply and minimal tension to reduce the risk of anastomotic leakage.\n\nIn more urgent situations, or if the patient's condition poses increased surgical risks, a Hartmann’s procedure is often chosen. This involves resecting the diseased bowel segment and creating an end-colostomy, with plans for potential future reconnection once the patient is stable and healed. Hartmann's procedure is particularly useful when there's concern about the feasibility or safety of immediate anastomosis, essentially prioritizing patient safety and minimizing complications.\n\nAs advancements in surgical techniques, such as the use of diverting stomas or colonic stenting in select patients, may offer alternative strategies, the decision ultimately hinges on the clinical judgment of the surgical team. Each approach has its merits, and the choice must be tailored to the individual's condition."}
{"question": "A lady presents with bilateral buccal reticulate white streaks, and she experiences increased pain when consuming spicy food. She reports no history of tobacco use but has an amalgam filling on the third molar. Based on these symptoms and details, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms described—bilateral buccal reticulate white streaks, increased pain when consuming spicy food, no history of tobacco use, and an isolated amalgam filling—the most likely diagnosis is oral lichen planus. The presence of Wickham's striae, which are white lacy patterns, combined with the bilateral nature of the lesions and sensitivity to spicy foods, strongly points towards this condition. Although lichenoid reactions related to dental materials like amalgam are possible, their presentation is usually more localized and asymmetrical, unlike the bilateral pattern observed in this case. Therefore, oral lichen planus is the most fitting diagnosis given the presented facts."}

What is the standard treatment for this condition?", "gold_answer": "The symptoms described—jaundice, extrapyramidal symptoms, and the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings—are characteristic of Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder leading to excessive copper accumulation in the body. The standard treatment for Wilson's disease is the use of a chelating agent to remove the excess copper. The primary treatment typically involves the use of penicillamine, which binds to the accumulated copper and facilitates its excretion from the body. If penicillamine is not suitable or tolerated, alternatives like trientine or zinc therapy can be considered."}
{"question": "Based on the presented case details of the 28-year-old female patient, including her history of severe postpartum hemorrhage, failure to lactate, infrequent menses, weight gain with decreased appetite, bradycardia, mild edema, and diffusely dry skin, what is the most likely laboratory finding associated with her symptoms?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms and clinical history provided for the 28-year-old woman, she is likely experiencing Sheehan’s syndrome, a condition where the pituitary gland is damaged due to severe blood loss during childbirth, leading to hypopituitarism. This condition results in the insufficient production of pituitary hormones.\n\nThe most likely laboratory finding in this case would be low levels of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) combined with low Free T4 levels, indicating secondary hypothyroidism. This aligns with the symptoms of bradycardia, weight gain, decreased appetite, and dry skin. Additionally, the pituitary damage might also result in low levels of Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH), causing low cortisol levels, which can contribute to the edema and overall fatigue.\n\nTherefore, the key laboratory finding that correlates most closely with her symptoms would be low TSH and low Free T4 levels."}
{"question": "A 5-week-old male infant is diagnosed with an absence of the thymus and inferior parathyroid glands at birth. Which pharyngeal arch abnormality is most likely responsible for this condition?", "gold_answer": "The condition described in the question is closely associated with an abnormality in the development of the third pharyngeal pouch. The third pharyngeal pouch is responsible for the formation of both the thymus and the inferior parathyroid glands during embryonic development. If there is an issue with the development of this pouch, it can lead to the absence or malformation of these structures.\n\nOne of the syndromes associated with such developmental issues is DiGeorge syndrome, which often involves defects in the third and sometimes the fourth pharyngeal pouches. The absence of the thymus and inferior parathyroid glands observed in the infant points to a problem originating from the third pharyngeal pouch. Therefore, the abnormality most likely responsible for this condition is a developmental issue in the third pharyngeal pouch."}
{"question": "Which ventilation mode helps in reducing the work of breathing by overcoming the resistance created by ventilator tubing?", "gold_answer": "Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) is the mode that helps in reducing the work of breathing by overcoming the resistance created by ventilator tubing. In PSV, the ventilator provides a boost of pressure to each spontaneous breath, helping to counteract the added resistance and making it easier for the patient to inhale. This mode efficiently assists in reducing the effort required to breathe through the ventilator circuit."}

{"question": "A 30-year-old male presents to the ER with chest pain episodes associated with cocaine use, showing ST elevation in leads V2-V6 on an ECG, while Troponin T is negative. What is the most appropriate intervention to manage his condition?", "gold_answer": "The patient is experiencing chest pain and ST elevation in leads V2-V6 due to cocaine use, but with negative Troponin T levels, indicating this is likely due to cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm rather than a myocardial infarction. In this situation, the most appropriate intervention is to use a calcium channel blocker, which can help alleviate the vasospasm by relaxing the blood vessels. Nitrates can also be considered for their vasodilatory effects. However, avoid using beta-blockers as they can worsen coronary vasospasm in the context of cocaine use. Therefore, prescribing a calcium channel blocker is the best course of action to manage this condition."}
{"question": "Identify the specific foramen that enables cerebrospinal fluid to pass directly from the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space.", "gold_answer": "The specific foramen that enables cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to pass directly from the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space is the median aperture, also known as the foramen of Magendie. This opening is crucial for allowing CSF to exit the fourth ventricle and circulate around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space."}
{"question": "A 33-year-old man arrives at the emergency department with bloody emesis, increasing dyspnea, and a background of peptic ulcer disease and end-stage renal disease for which he has been receiving regular hemodialysis. After skipping his last dialysis session, his examination reveals orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, cold extremities, and signs of metabolic distress, including flapping tremor. Initial management with intravenous isotonic saline and high-dose proton pump inhibitors is started, and he is admitted to the ICU. Given this clinical scenario, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of his condition?", "gold_answer": "Given the patient's symptoms and clinical background, the most appropriate next step in managing his condition is to urgently initiate hemodialysis. His missed dialysis session likely led to the accumulation of uremic toxins and electrolyte imbalances, contributing to his current presentation, including metabolic distress and cardiovascular instability. Hemodialysis will help remove these toxins, correct electrolyte imbalances, and stabilize his condition."}
{"question": "Based on the symptoms of fever for two weeks, petechial spots, increasing pallor over one month, and splenomegaly detected in a 5-year-old child, what is the most likely diagnosis?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms described – a prolonged fever lasting two weeks, petechial spots, increasing pallor over a month, and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) – the most likely diagnosis for this 5-year-old child is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ALL is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood, leading to symptoms such as anemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), frequent infections, and splenomegaly. These symptoms align well with the presentation of ALL, which is the most common leukemia in children. Prompt medical evaluation and diagnostic testing, such as a complete blood count and bone marrow biopsy, are crucial for confirming the diagnosis and starting appropriate treatment."}
{"question": "A 34-year-old female presents with fatigue, decreased energy, weight gain, constipation, myalgias, and cold intolerance, with a notable physical exam finding of delayed deep tendon reflex relaxation and a normal vital signs assessment. Considering these clinical features, what is the best initial screening test to consider for this patient?", "gold_answer": "Based on the symptoms and physical exam findings you've described, the best initial screening test to consider for this patient is the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. The combination of fatigue, unexplained weight gain, constipation, muscle aches, sensitivity to cold, and delayed deep tendon reflex relaxation are classic indicators of hypothyroidism. Measuring the TSH level is a reliable way to assess thyroid function and help determine if the thyroid is underactive, which fits with the clinical picture presented."}
{"question": "A 25-year-old G2P1 woman at 12 weeks gestational age presents to the office to discuss the results of her routine prenatal screening labs, which were ordered during her 1st prenatal visit. She reports taking a daily prenatal vitamin but no other medications. She complains of mild fatigue and appears pale on exam. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows the following:\nHemoglobin (Hb) 9.5 g/dL\nHematocrit 29%\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV) 75 µm3\nWhich of the following are the most likely hematologic states of the patient and her fetus?\nA. Folate deficiency anemia in both the mother and the fetus\nB. Iron deficiency anemia in the mother; normal Hb levels in the fetus\nC. Pernicious anemia in the mother; normal Hb levels in the fetus\nD. Physiologic anemia in the mother; normal Hb levels in the fetus", "gold_answer": "The laboratory results and clinical presentation of the 25-year-old woman indicate iron deficiency anemia, characterized by a low hemoglobin level, low hematocrit, and a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which are consistent with microcytic anemia. During pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia is common due to increased iron demands from the developing fetus and the expanding maternal blood volume. The mother's symptoms of fatigue and pallor support this diagnosis.\n\nRegarding the fetus, even if the mother has iron deficiency anemia, the fetus typically maintains normal hemoglobin levels because the maternal-fetal exchange prioritizes the fetus's nutritional needs. Therefore, it is likely that the fetus has normal hemoglobin levels at this stage of pregnancy.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely hematologic states of the patient and her fetus are:\n\nB. Iron deficiency anemia in the mother; normal Hb levels in the fetus"}
{"question": "A 22-year-old woman presents with increased vaginal discharge. She recently changed her sexual partner and they do not use condoms. Her vital signs are stable and her physical examination shows a white-yellow vaginal discharge. Wet mount microscopy reveals the presence of motile trichomonads. What is the appropriate treatment for this condition?", "gold_answer": "The appropriate treatment for trichomoniasis, which is indicated by the presence of motile trichomonads in the vaginal discharge, is metronidazole. It can be administered either as a single large dose or over the course of several days, depending on the specific clinical situation and patient preference. This is consistent with medical guidelines and is considered effective for treating this sexually transmitted infection."}
